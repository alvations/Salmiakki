These issues are now being regulated at European level and recommendations are being made as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
We believe that , as all representation within the European Union is carried out by people from the Member States , it is the latter which are mainly responsible for mobilising as many women as possible who can rise within the decision-making process .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Seixas da Costa , very much for his reply , which gives us hope since it demonstrates that the Council understands the problem , is responding politically and perhaps even sympathises with the idea .
Nevertheless , I consider his reply to be basically too retrograde .
The Helsinki and Cologne Summits specifically gave the Portuguese Presidency the job of strengthening this new protection policy .
You have said that you are against quotas but in favour of references .
I would like to ask the Portuguese Presidency : do you not think it would be highly appropriate to include a reference , in the form of a recommendation , in this respect ?
I believe that the role of the European Union should not be to remain behind the United Nations or to be content merely with a reference to what Beijing was about .
The European Union must be progressive .
Women must clearly be involved in political decisions - also decisions with regard to peace - and I ask the Portuguese Presidency to make some reference in this respect .
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , thank you for the hope which you have placed in the Portuguese presidency.However , I am sure you are aware of the limits of what we can do , particularly in an area such as this .
I have no hesitation in saying this because in my own departments 80 % of the officials are women , even in managerial posts .
It is therefore clear that hope must always be the last resort of political action and that equal opportunities and equal representation of the sexes must be the practical and specific goal in our daily life and actions .
To be totally frank and at the risk of being considered behind the times , I do believe that there are limits to what can be achieved by pro-active political action in this area .
Bearing in mind these limits , it will be rather difficult , when we set out to assess the new common foreign and security policy structures in terms of defence , to say to the Military Committee or the Military Staff that half of their soldiers should be female .
This is because it is up to the Member States whether or not they have female generals or brigadiers .
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I cannot raise an issue like this just to appear politically correct.I must always be objectively honest .
Question No 10 by ( H-0276 / 00 ) :
Subject : Participation of research partners from the developing countries in environmental research programmes funded by the EU The key to the development of the developing countries is their ability to participate in development work themselves both as definers of problems and as seekers for solutions .
On the other hand , at EU level this approach is being poorly applied in relation to science and technology projects affecting developing countries .
The EU &apos; s framework programmes do not extend to the developing countries .
This means that North African partners , for example , are not able to be involved in science and technology projects relating to the environment .
In fact no-one is preventing them from carrying out the research , but there are no funding opportunities , and thus the developing countries have no access to consortia as partners entitled to apply for funding .
Why is this not the case , given that opportunities have been devised for even Russia , for example , to be involved ?
Has the matter been considered from the point of view of the extent to which , for example , desertification in North Africa or the problems of the Mediterranean affect the EU ?
Is the EU prepared to provide greater responsibility in the form of funding to local researchers , so that research activities can combine even after the funding bodies have left , and to ensure that projects can be carried out without the investment of local researchers ?
In 1998 , the European Parliament and the Council adopted the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development to run from then until 2002 .
One aspect of this Framework Programme is its four thematic programmes , which define priority areas for research , and its three horizontal programmes .
One of the latter is entitled &apos; Confirming the international role of Community research &apos; and is intended to promote scientific and technological cooperation at international level and to help implement Community foreign policy in this area .
The general objectives of this international scientific cooperation are also set out in this Framework Programme and include support for the development of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership and a contribution to the economic , social and scientific development of developing countries .
In December 1998 , the Council also adopted rules on participation by undertakings , research centres and universities and on disseminating research results in order to implement the Fifth Framework Programme .
With regard to the participation of legal entities of third countries and international organisations , all the indirect research activities under the thematic programmes are open to research bodies in Mediterranean non-Community countries and developing countries , in principle without Community financing.The only exception to this involves situations in which Community financing is regarded as absolutely vital to achieve the aims of the activity .
Article 6 of the Framework Programme authorises the participation by entities of third countries in specific research and technological development activities under the horizontal programme on the international role of Community research .
In January last year , the Council adopted the specific programmes for the Fifth Framework Programme which set out the objectives and activities for the various categories of third countries .
With regard to Mediterranean non-Community countries , an indicative allocation of EUR 55 million was established for research and development activities such as integrated coastal management in the Mediterranean , including environmental aspects , water management , natural resource management , conservation and restoration of the cultural heritage , socio-economic modernisation and so on .
With regard to developing countries , an indicative allocation of EUR 210 million was made available for specific activities such as those involving the adoption of innovations , the promotion of a sustainable relationship between population pressure , food safety and the use and management of ecosystems , the improvement of productivity and the prevention of damage to natural resources .
In addition , a grant system was created under a specific programme which allows graduates and doctoral students from developing countries and Mediterranean non-Community countries to work on European projects .
Funds were also allocated for coordination with Community technical assistance programmes , including the MEDA and EDF programmes , and also for Latin America and Asia .
The application of these three decisions is clearly the Commission &apos; s responsibility , supported by the committees for the relevant programmes .
So far calls for specific proposals aimed at developing and Mediterranean countries have been made with a total budget of EUR 85.5 million .
Mr President-in-Office , I thank you for this reply .
I would , however , like a brief answer that is clearer and more precise .
Do we then have a situation where the developing countries may now apply for funds ?
They were not able to before .
How is the situation different from , for example , that regarding the INTAS and Interreg programmes in Eastern Europe ?
With regard to matters falling within the Commission &apos; s specific competence , the only promise I can make , in answer to the Member &apos; s supplementary question and her concerns , is that I will try to obtain a more concise answer which will probably have to be given in writing .
As the author is not present , Question No 11 lapses .
Question No 12 by ( H-0277 / 00 ) :
Subject : Common defence policy at the IGC There is a &apos; shortlist &apos; of proposals for the IGC , according to which the Conference will confine itself largely to &apos; institutional &apos; issues .
It is generally supposed that Portugal plans to expand the list at the June meeting .
Is this true , and will Portugal then bring the common defence policy onto the agenda for the IGC ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Helsinki European Council authorised the Portuguese presidency to establish the EU &apos; s interim security and defence structures as from 1 March of this year .
These structures were established on this date .
Their activities are currently being developed so that they can assume a more specific and practical form and in particular so that the definitive model which we believe could start to operate next year can be agreed .
In parallel with the work on these practical aspects , a discussion is ongoing within the European Union on determining the mechanisms for participation both by EU Member States which are not members of NATO and by NATO countries which are not EU Member States.This discussion is occurring within the overall context of action on the Petersberg tasks specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
The question which has arisen and which has also been raised by the Member - for which I thank you as it is my responsibility to chair the preparatory group of the Intergovernmental Conference - concerns the extent to which this issue may or may not fall within the scope of the IGC .
It will only be placed on the IGC &apos; s agenda if and when it is confirmed that amendments need to be made to the Treaty on European Union in order to bring these structures into practical operation .
It is still not clear at this stage of our debate within the European Union whether or not amendments to the Treaty will be necessary .
As soon as this becomes clear , we will announce this .
The Portuguese Presidency will present a report to the Feira European Council in June giving an assessment of the state of progress and an opinion on whether or not these issues should be included within the IGC .
If these are to be included , this would only be confirmed during the French Presidency .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , European defence policy is at present being drafted , and different countries are involved in the task .
There are Member States in NATO and there are countries which are not in NATO .
Mr President-in-Office , do you believe that the European Union can frame a defence policy that would be independent of NATO , or will all the new arrangements be in harmony with NATO &apos; s basic structures ?
Mr Seppänen , your question indicates that you are clearly confused , unless there has been an interpreting error .
We are not talking about defence policy but about crisis management for which powers are now included within the Treaties.The issue in question is not therefore a European defence policy or the creation of a European army .
The issue is crisis management and humanitarian actions which are commonly referred to in Community parlance as the &apos; Petersberg tasks &apos; .
All the EU countries , including yours , can make a valuable contribution to this area .
We are trying at the moment not to create a European defence policy but rather a common culture of security allowing us to participate in crisis management .
In this respect , I can see no major problems .
We hope to ensure that all the various cultures which exist within the Union are compatible .
The crisis management and humanitarian actions specified in the Petersberg tasks to which the Helsinki European Council referred are actions which may be carried out by the European Union.However , our intention is to guarantee that these actions are totally compatible with what currently exists in the relations between certain EU Member States and the NATO countries .
The reason for this is that the mechanisms and means which exist for managing these crises are not extensive .
In fact , most of the time , these means belong to NATO .
As it is the means for military and security action which currently exist within the EU and NATO which will be mobilised , it is therefore essential to guarantee effective cooperation with all the NATO countries , including non-Community countries and particularly the candidate countries such as Turkey , Norway and Iceland .
It is clear that at a much wider level and bearing in mind the dimension of the operations , these actions will also require the involvement of the United States of America and Canada .
We therefore need broad cooperation which aims to guarantee the sharing of responsibility among all those countries which currently have a similar security and defence culture and objective .
Question No 13 by ( H-0283 / 00 ) :
Subject : Violation of the right to freedom of expression The Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki , presided over by a single magistrate , recently banned from circulation a book by the author Mimis Androulakis , describing it as irreverent .
Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam states that the European Union is founded on the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Furthermore , Greece is a contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights , which guarantees the right to freedom of expression and religious freedom .
In view of these considerations and given that the cornerstone of a people &apos; s Europe is the fundamental commitment to freedom , pluralism and human rights , what view does the Council take of such a measure and will it intercede with the competent Greek authorities to put an end to the persecution of the author and the ban on his book ?
Mr Papayannakis is asking the Council how it interprets this judgement of the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki banning from circulation a book by the author Mimis Androlakis which it describes as irreverent .
He is also asking whether the Council intends to intercede with the Greek authorities .
I should like to explain that , under Article 6 ( 1 ) of the Treaty on European Union , as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Union respects a set of basic principles by reference to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
The underlying aim of this article is to establish a kind of political supervision over the actions of Member States and to ensure that democratic principles and values are respected .
It is intended to guarantee the sharing of common values .
However , Article 6 cannot be invoked for the purpose of any type of interference in the administration of the internal affairs of Member States , particularly at judicial level .
The Union has no competence to intercede in the exercise of legal power by the Member States .
Therefore , the Council cannot interfere in the decision-making of the authorities .
The judgement delivered by the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki , which is a judgement of a legal body of a Member State on a specific case , may be subject within the Greek legal system to an appeal to the higher national courts .
Having exhausted this recourse to the Greek courts , there would always be recourse to the Court of Human Rights .
Mr Sjöstedt , the Member States undertake to act within the framework determined by the Treaty .
This is why they signed the Treaty .
If a serious and persistent violation of citizens &apos; rights were to be identified , according to the terms of these articles , then there would clearly be ways of interceding with the Member States .
The Union itself has ways of doing this but only in specific cases .
A case like this , in a democratic country like Greece , meets all the conditions to be judged and handled within the Greek legal system until the capacities for recourse within this system are exhausted .
If we were to intervene in a case like this , we would clearly be transposing to the Community dimension an issue for which there is a whole range of recourse in a country which fully respects human and citizens &apos; rights .
Thank you very much , Mr Seixas da Costa .
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed , Questions Nos 14 to 31 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Address by Mr Klestil , President of the Republic of Austria
Mr President , you expressed the wish to speak today at our Parliament &apos; s formal sitting .
It has always been the case that any EU Member State Heads of State who express that wish are received among us with the consideration due to their person , the high office they hold and the nation over which they preside .
( Loud applause ) It is in that spirit that I now welcome you on behalf of the European Parliament .
At the beginning of this year 2000 , the constitution of the present Austrian Government has , as you know , given rise to some strong feelings in all the EU Member States , among their governments as well as their people .
( Loud applause ) In the case of this Parliament , one question broadly transcends any political or national divergences between its Members , and that is their attachment to the values on which the European Union is founded and their determined resistance to the rise in racist and xenophobic ideologies .
( Loud applause ) Mr President , we know that you were not in favour of this coalition , in which an extreme right-wing party has an equal share , and that you spared no efforts to find an alternative solution ...
( Uproar on the far right ) ... and that , before agreeing to what you believed you could not prevent , you demanded and obtained from the political leaders concerned a strong commitment to the values on which the European Union are founded .
( Applause , and protests from the far right ) It is in that context and in a spirit of profound friendship and respect for the Austrian people that we will listen carefully to the message you wished to pass on to the European Parliament .
We have no doubt , Mr President , that it will take account of the very serious concerns our Parliament expressed by an overwhelming majority , on 3 February last.Without further ado , I therefore give you the floor .
( As President Klestil prepared to take the floor , many left-wing Members left the Chamber .
Interjection from Mrs Muscardini : &quot; So that is democracy , not to give a hearing to speakers ... &quot; )
Mr President , we have now heard you .
Thank you for your statement and for the personal convictions you expressed .
We have been aware of them for many years ; they are strong and we did not doubt them .
In a few hours &apos; time , the group chairmen and I myself will be meeting you again , this time for an informal exchange of views in camera .
So I will not comment at any length on what you have just said to us .
To conclude this formal sitting , let me simply point out that our vigilance is not directed against the Austrian people as a whole , whom we respect and love and who , as we know and as you reminded us , remain strongly attached to the European Union .
Our vigilance is not partisan .
We are not trying to impugn anyone &apos; s motives , nor are we unaware of the particular political situation your country found itself in at the last elections .
Nor are we interfering , for the European Union is not only a market , it is a community of values , and I am grateful to you , Mr President , for pointing that out again .
What happens in one country cannot be a matter of indifference to the others .
We are concerned and vigilant because of one fact and one memory .
The fact is that a party of a xenophobic persuasion forms part of the Austrian Government , and you said with some force , Mr President , that you understood the anxiety about a possible new upsurge of racism , of intolerance , of xenophobia and of anti-Semitism .
The memory is of a time in history that tore Europe apart because peoples , and above all their leaders , did not have the strength to react while there was still time .
( Applause ) It is because of that duty to remember that we cannot accept the way that the extreme right is gaining ground .
( Applause )
Nothing would be more dangerous to a human society than for its collective conscience to weaken , for it to become accustomed to the unacceptable and for it to relativise the intolerable .
( Applause )
Thank you , Mr President , for your replies a short while ago to our questions , which give us hope that Austria can once again become a full partner in our Union , which it has never ceased to be in legal terms ...
( Uproar on the far right ) ... but what we hope , Mr President , is that it will also become so in our minds and , to tell the truth , in our hearts .
( Loud applause .
Uproar on the far right )
( The formal sitting was closed at 12.30 p.m. )
Financial services and complementary pensions
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
A5-0059 / 2000 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission communication on implementing the framework for financial markets : Action Plan &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 232 - C5-0114 / 1999 - 1999 / 2117 ( COS ) &#93; ;
A5-0053 / 2000 by Mr Kuckelkorn , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission communication &quot; Towards a single market for supplementary pensions - Results of the consultations on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market &quot; &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 134 - C5-0135 / 1999 - 1999 / 2131 ( COS ) &#93; .
Before we begin I would like to advise you that , since this is a night sitting and we have a lot of work to get through , I am going to be very strict in applying time limits .
I therefore also ask Members to show an appropriate degree of self-discipline so that we can finish at a reasonable time .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , if I had to point here and now to two complex issues in the economic field , I would no doubt choose the following : the consolidation of the financial markets and the approximation of the direct taxation regulations - specifically tax on savings - which is under discussion .
The debate which we held recently on the bodies for collective investment in transferable securities and the reactions to the report on pension funds , which we will hear shortly , demonstrate the complexity and importance of these issues .
These two issues , the liberalisation of the financial services market and taxation , are dealt with in the action plan which is the subject of my report .
It is therefore appropriate to thank all the groups for their cooperation and confirm once again to the Commission that it can rely on the active cooperation of the European Parliament in the implementation of this plan , and we will not disregard our duties , but exercise them responsibly .
The complexity of the action plan also reflects the ambitious nature of the report presented by the Commission , which contains 43 measures and involves all the sectors in the field ( stock exchanges , banks , investment funds , insurance , etc . ) and which applies to what has come to be called the &apos; new economy &apos; , which is - according to the Lisbon Summit - one of the elements which will help to put an end to unemployment in Europe .
What is included in these measures ?
What is intended through these measures ?
In my judgement , to sum up , it is the following : the liberalisation of the financial sectors and the updating of the regulations on supervision and control in order to achieve a European financial market which is at least as competitive as the United States financial market .
In the explanatory statement , I offer a detailed comparison of the two types of market .
In order to achieve these two objectives , the Commission proposes a truly arguable and risky formula : the speeding up of the legal process , which , in turn , would involve three actions .
Firstly , a reduction in the standards which need to be included in a regulation or directive , that is to say , which require the participation of this Parliament .
Secondly , limiting those standards to the definition of the general approaches and basic principles which must be established in this field , allowing the Commission the possibility of implementing them .
Thirdly , granting the Commission broad powers of interpretation .
I do not doubt that we have to speed up the process , Commissioner , but this Parliament is not prepared to relinquish the powers which it has taken so long to acquire .
Therefore , one of the first tasks which we will have to undertake together is to find a model which will satisfy both objectives .
With regard to liberalisation , the first of the tasks which the Commission proposes , the Commission starts from one premise : the consolidation of the single market in financial services requires the removal of the barriers which hinder its operation .
We could not agree more .
The consequence is that , in order for the market to function , these barriers must be removed .
Again we agree , but we know that there are difficulties in this approach resulting from the need to reconcile the objective of liberalisation with the objective of protecting investors .
Firstly , the barriers are not identified .
Commissioner , it is not sufficient to be able to deduce what they are from the measures proposed by the Commission .
Personally , I would have liked to have seen a list of those national measures which , in accordance with the Directive on financial services , are hindering the operation of the market in each country .
Secondly , the solution proposed by the Commission still raises difficulties .
It is ridiculous that a financial company has to operate while being subject to , and having to have knowledge of , fifteen different legislations , but it is at least as ridiculous that an investor - especially a non-professional investor - should end up needing to contract services , bound by regulations which he or she does not know , from companies whose solvency is unknown , and , in the event of legal dispute , he or she has to take action in a foreign country , with foreign jurisdiction and procedures .
Liberalisation must therefore be implemented in parallel with the increase in measures relating to control and taxation .
With regard to control measures , we have a new problem : the need to adapt the competence and jurisdictions of authorities which are still national and which , on the whole , apply differing models , to a different world affected by globalisation , international competition and free movement of capital .
Finally , Mr President , my personal conviction is that , if we do not want liberalisation to give rise to distortions in competition and the flight of capital to more beneficial climates inside and outside the Union , the correct operation of the market in financial services will not be possible without a certain degree of approximation of the laws which regulate savings .
These are the concerns which are raised in my report.These concerns reflect a constructive attitude towards cooperation with the Commission , which I have always considered to be a loyal ally of this Parliament , in the development of an issue which is so very complex .
Mr President , I am referring , as you have said , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , to the Commission communication on the action plan for the implementation of the framework for the financial markets .
As the main rapporteur , Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , has pointed out , in this regard there are two questions which are , firstly , taxation - without fiscal harmonisation it would be very difficult to establish Community financial markets - and secondly , a legal framework .
With regard to the legal framework , I believe that there is a paradox in this sector .
The more liberalised an economy is , the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets .
The American economy , which is probably one of the most liberalised economies in existence , is the economy which lays down the most detailed regulations for the financial markets .
The Commission , in its proposal , on page 18 of the Spanish version , after recognising the competence of Parliament by means of codecision , in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty , tells us that we should move towards very flexible procedures by means of comitology .
Comitology in these cases usually means taking away with one hand what is given with the other .
In this respect , I am in total agreement with the conclusions of the rapporteur .
I believe that we need some very specific legislation and I am sure that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in the drawing up of this legislation .
As the rapporteur said a moment ago , we cannot expect confidence on the part of investors , consumers and , ultimately , the financial markets , if they do not have a specific legal framework in which to operate .
The only way to do this is to replace the current rigid regulations with a set of specific Community regulations which will produce certainty in this very delicate sector of the economy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy deplores the fact that the action plan for the financial markets does not take into account the problems which industry , small and medium-sized businesses in particular , is facing with regard to financing cross-border activities .
Many businesses , ranging from small businesses in border areas to large multinationals , would like to treat their accounts as one national account .
For example , they would like to use funds in their euro account in country A to settle an account in debit in country B. In this way , they would pay less interest .
Existing legislation , however , prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique .
The world of banking has already driven this problem home to you on numerous occasions .
On behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would now like to ask the Commissioner whether it would be possible to set up a forum group which carries out market research into the legal and fiscal obstacles for businesses , SMBs , in particular , when they finance their cross-border transactions within the euro zone , in order to solve this problem .
I would appreciate a reply to this .
Mr President , in view of the Resolution of 3 December 1998 , to which the Kuckelkorn report does not appear to contain a reference , Parliament once again is obliged to request that the Commission produce as soon as possible a directive or , as Mr Medina Ortega appropriately suggested , a Community law coordinating the various national laws .
The Commission appears to be somewhat apathetic in this regard , and seems to be concentrating rather on producing a directive on prudential rules for pension funds , which is easier to achieve but less effective in terms of decision-making in relation to the elimination of barriers to labour mobility and the coordination of taxation systems .
The legal bases are very important , and , clearly , different : in view of the various judgements delivered by the Court of Justice , pension funds could be governed by Article 47 and Article 55 , the removal of barriers to labour mobility could be governed by Article 42 and the coordination of national tax systems by Article 94 .
However , I would stress the need and the desirability to develop a single package , because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which tones down the extreme positions contained in certain proposals for amendments .
I refer , in particular , to biometric risks , which are a very important factor but which should be dealt with on the basis of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.Indeed , making cover for biometric risks obligatory would be likely to make the system very inflexible .
I therefore feel that funds which cover biometric risks should receive privileged treatment , and that any inflexibility of the system could , in effect , result in negative imbalances for the beneficiaries .
Mr President , we see the reality of the situation all around us .
If 23 % of Europe &apos; s population is over 65 years old today , this figure will have reached 40 % by 2025 , and the proportion of four working people to every retired person will have become two working people to every retired person by 2020 .
This demonstrates the pressing need to allow the development of supplementary self-funded high return pension schemes in the European Union to usefully supplement state contributory pension schemes .
As we all know , our Member States are working towards ambitious structural reforms , but it is also up to the European Union to intervene in the area of pensions , particularly supplementary pensions , in order to facilitate the free movement of workers in the context of the single market , to establish a genuine single capital market and also to ensure that equality between men and women is respected .
With this in mind , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been concerned to reconcile the security and efficiency of supplementary pensions for future pensioners as it is true that the guarantee of a high level of security for beneficiaries encourages healthy and desirable competition between European pension funds .
This is why our Committee feels that the proposal for a directive on Community prudential regulations applying to pension funds must be tabled and adopted as quickly as possible , bearing in mind our discussion today , with proper guarantees for the external and internal supervision of the funds concerned and for the calculation of their prudential commitment .
Furthermore , in order to encourage the free movement of workers , we felt it essential to quickly improve the transferability and the acquisition of pension rights from supplementary schemes from different European countries .
This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
. ( FR ) Mr President , I would like to say first of all in this debate that we are expecting to see a proposal for a framework-directive very soon , which will guarantee the development of a genuine single market for supplementary pension funds under the second and third pillars , given that the first pillar , which covers all biometric risks , must remain the cornerstone of the European Union &apos; s social protection system .
This directive must in particular establish a framework to remove obstacles to the free choice of a pension fund , to the free movement of people , to the free provision of services and to charging double taxes .
We recommend a solution based on the principle that contributions should be tax-deductible , and that supplementary invested income should be taxed in accordance with the income tax law in force in the country of residence .
On the controversial issue of whether supplementary pension schemes should cover biometric risks , I wish to state that from the point of view of taxation , pension funds that do not cover these risks will not be discriminated against in relation to those that do .
With regard to prudential regulation , this should not be disproportionate , so that the security of the fund is guaranteed .
That covers the general framework .
I am grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having included all the relevant conclusions of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities in the motion for a resolution .
I now come to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil .
With regard to the action plan which seeks to deepen the internal financial services market , I would like to issue a warning about certain strategists who are attempting to hold the liberalisation of the financial services sector hostage , because the work that has been undertaken on the taxation of savings has not made the progress they would have wanted .
As matters currently stand , we should remember that a single market for capital and financial services can function perfectly well without tax harmonisation .
Faced with proposals that confuse ambition and reality , I wish to emphasise that establishing a European Committee for stock exchange operations is certainly not the number one priority and , as I have no speaking time left , Mr President , I will give an explanation of vote tomorrow to say the rest of what I still wanted to say , because as draftsperson of the Committee &apos; s opinion and as a speaker on the second report , it is really impossible to say everything in two minutes .
Mr President , representatives of the Commission and the Council , Mr Kuckelkorn , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to thank the Commission for the sterling work they have done .
The communication from the Commission is liberal-minded and forward-looking .
Why should Parliament now adopt a less liberal position and vote in favour of stagnating structures ?
We should not define the form and scope of the directive too narrowly .
What we need to do instead is to view the issue openly and from a wider perspective .
It is essential that we do not define the nature and scope of the risk coverage in a restrictive way .
Instead , we should be open-minded and look at the issue from a wider perspective and encourage a framework which is based on liberal markets and vigorous competition between different types of pension schemes .
What we should promote is the freedom of choice of the employee and the employer to choose the kind of scheme that best suits their interests
The question of biometric risks has proved to be of a controversial nature .
My firm opinion is that all the different pension schemes should be covered by the same directive in order not to protect certain types of schemes from competition .
Consumers and employers must have the right to choose the most suitable form of pension scheme and , therefore , schemes covering biometric risks should be treated under the same directive as schemes not covering these risks .
Both form a pension scheme but focus on different competitive benefits .
Mr Kuckelkorn , no-one in this Parliament is of the opinion that supplementary pensions should not cover the longevity risk , through the purchase of an annuity or by some other tool .
It is not the task of the European Union to define the nature and scope of the risk coverage concerning other biometric risks .
But it should be determined individually by each employee , as the Commission proposes .
Leaving this kind of decision to the individual is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity .
Allowing supplementary pension scheme managers the freedom to invest in a diverse range of instruments increases the security of the overall investment portfolio .
Increased freedom promotes the functioning of the capital market and has a significant impact on the growth of venture capital in Europe .
I am committed to the idea that we , as the European Parliament , should encourage healthy competition and the freedom of choice of the individual .
This must not only mean a single market for supplementary pensions , but the whole package of legislation concerning the financial services .
Mr President , the Socialists support the Commission &apos; s efforts to establish a transparent and fluid internal financial services market .
It is in the interest of economic operators and all consumers that the costs of capital and financial intermediation should be as low as possible .
European financial markets are currently suffering from compartmentalisation along national lines , even though , following the globalisation of the international financial system , we are seeing the widespread phenomenon of mergers and internationalisation .
The action plan aims to make the European market equal to the American market .
The success of the American market is basically due to &apos; king dollar &apos; .
It is paradoxical in this context to note that some of the most ardent supporters of financial liberalisation at the same time oppose the euro .
The real introduction of the euro in 2002 , however , will result in transparency and competition , which will force the national markets to adapt more quickly than they had anticipated .
The problem is that the legislative bodies , both national and European , are taking a long time to adapt the law to reality .
Personally , I would not be opposed to an accelerated legislative procedure , on condition that it does not end up as a mere exercise for non-accountable technocrats .
The Commission could make a useful contribution in the form of proposals simplifying and codifying the 11 or so directives that govern the banking sector , the 8 directives on investment funds , and the 21 directives dealing with the insurance sector .
There is not only a problem of coherence in the various legislations on the different sectors of the financial world , but in particular there is the problem of supervising and protecting the public interest .
John Kenneth Galbraith condemned the mistaken idea that there is any link between money and intelligence .
The lure of profit is such that the financial world tends to create a form of collective euphoria , which often leads to financial crisis .
The free movement of capital must be accompanied by an efficient regulatory and prudential framework , because supervision of the various markets is divided up according to country and sector , but at the same time , as a result of mergers , acquisitions and amalgamations , boundaries between banks , insurance companies , investment funds and pension funds are disappearing .
Finland and the United Kingdom have drawn conclusions from this and have established a single prudential authority for the whole sector .
Article 105 ( 6 ) of the Treaty stipulates that the Council can entrust the ECB with specific tasks relating to policies on the prudential supervision of credit companies and other financial companies , with the exception of insurance companies .
Should the Council not use the Intergovernmental Conference to establish the necessary legal basis for the Council to be able to entrust the ECB with certain specific tasks relating to the prudential supervision of insurance companies too ?
I must congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Kuckelkorn , for the tenacity with which he argues in favour of supplementary pensions and for these to become in effect a second pillar of insurance for old age .
I shall conclude , Mr President , by pointing out that it amounts to saying that whilst we should not discard insurance products we must favour products which cover biometric risks .
Mr President , Commissioner , if Europe is to grow , attract capital and create jobs , the single market for financial services must be turned into a reality .
Up until now , it has mostly been a matter of words and all too few concrete measures .
At present , the financial services market and , through this , Europe &apos; s power to grow have been impeded by countless national regulations and administrative complications .
These are detrimental not only to companies but also , of course , to Europe &apos; s citizens .
The development of the Internet is , and will be , of great importance to the provision of financial services across national borders .
Above all , it is consumers who will benefit from this development because they will have greater choice and access to lower prices .
We Liberals do not regard tax harmonisation as a prerequisite for bringing the single market for financial services to fruition , even if a degree of harmonisation may prove to be necessary to avoid harmful competition over taxes .
The euro has stabilised economic development and provided better opportunities to reduce the costs of acquiring capital , something which benefits both companies and private households .
It is my conviction that , if the EU is to be able to provide Europe &apos; s citizens with growth and strength , then all Member States must participate fully in the EU project , that is to say , be members of EMU .
Mr Romano Prodi &apos; s statement today in a Swedish newspaper to the effect that Sweden could stay outside EMU is therefore both surprising from an economic point of view and doubtful in terms of the Treaties .
The Commission &apos; s Green Paper on liberalising complementary forms of pension protection is something we welcome .
It is nonetheless important to emphasise that pension cover in Europe is characterised by national diversity and that there is no need to harmonise the various systems in order to create a single market .
It is important that a large number of systems should exist side by side .
This increases choice and diversity .
However , it is desirable , in order to avoid double taxation , to introduce a minimum degree of harmonisation in regard to the Member States &apos; treatment of supplementary pensions for tax purposes .
I also consider that the Member States themselves should be able to determine what the system should look like , for example whether or not the care of relatives should be covered by pensions .
This is an issue which can be resolved better at national level .
In committee there was lively discussion on biometric risks .
Views were put forward to the effect that only those systems which cover risks of this kind are to be included under the directive .
We do not believe that this should be the case , especially in view of the need for small and medium-sized companies to be able to do business .
Freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing .
Finally , I want to congratulate Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn for two important reports designed to create a competitive Europe .
Mr President , where supplementary pensions are concerned , the crucial issue is whether one wants to provide pensioners with security in their old age or to reinforce Europe &apos; s capital markets .
These are not only two quite different goals , but it is also difficult to combine them in one and the same system .
The Commission &apos; s proposal and both the reports we are debating today give priority to the needs of the capital market .
The hope is that the market-based pensions will then also prove to be good for pensioners in thirty or forty years &apos; time .
How matters will turn out , however , we do not know .
If one considers how Europe has changed during the last thirty to forty years and acknowledges that circumstances are going to change just as much in the future , then one can see how uncertain such forecasts are .
There is a large deficit when it comes to security and solidarity in the pensions area because the risk is so great and because there can never be enough security and solidarity .
Supplementary assurances are therefore a problem .
They are , of course , much less secure than a system of basic pensions which has been financed on the basis of solidarity .
I also believe that supplementary assurances and supplementary pensions may be needed , but then their managers ought to be obliged to invest in such instruments as provide solid savings in the long term , instead of having short-term rates on the stock exchange and global financial capitalism determine how matters will stand for pensioners in the future .
I also believe it would have been commendable if these supplementary pension systems could have been run as pension funds on the basis of solidarity under the aegis of trade unions , as happens in certain Member States .
Even if these too are market-based , they offer much more in terms of stability and security than the privatised pension assurances .
It now looks as if we are to have a liberal arrangement in the pensions field in Europe , and I shall therefore advise my voters to invest their surplus funds in safer instruments than private pension assurances .
To young people I would say : pin your hopes on education and on developing your skills .
And to older people I would say : acquire a nice , inexpensive place to live in the autumn of your years .
We politicians ought to be putting our faith in a good , sound system of basic pensions .
Mr President , the European Commission &apos; s Green Paper has caused many to reach for their pens , so much so that in the motion for a resolution , the objective of the Green Paper has been lost almost completely .
Similarly , the intention of the rapporteur , Mr Kuckelkorn , who has carried out a vast amount of work , for which I would like to thank him , is not expressed very well in the motion for a resolution .
It is now up to us to see that an acceptable document is produced tomorrow during the vote .
The principal aim is for workers , when they move to another Member State , to be able to transfer their supplementary pension schemes and continue to pay into them without forfeiting their pension rights and with a guarantee that their accumulated pension rights will retain their value .
Unfortunately , the Commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish .
We have a long way to go before the compulsory transfer of value between Member States will be a reality .
The first obstacle we need to negotiate is the mutual recognition of supervisory rules .
It is then important that an adequate distinction is drawn between pension funds and commercial insurance companies .
A pension fund has an obligation to be generally acceptable .
A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks .
Insurance companies do offer their participants a choice , and their products do not cover biometric risks .
Since the risks covered are not identical , government inspection will also vary for pension funds and insurance companies .
On account of this supervision , complete freedom of investment is justified in both cases .
This leads on average to higher returns .
We need to avoid creating a situation where the individual is forced , on account of significantly lower returns on pension funds , to enter the wild investment woods in search of their supplementary pension schemes , where the big bad wolf is after their money .
The second obstacle is the levying of taxes within the Member States .
Taking into account the fast approaching ageing of the population , it is desirable for fiscal systems to promote the development of supplementary pensions .
The EET model , where premium payments are tax-free and the retirement payout is taxed , meets this requirement and is also common in most Member States .
I hope that Parliament and the Commission will make the internal market for supplementary pension schemes a reality along these lines .
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , I would like to express my opinion on the single market for supplementary pensions .
Firstly , I would like to express my agreement with the model based on the intergenerational solidarity of the basic state systems , to which are added the supplementary capitalisation systems .
On the other hand , I would also like to express my agreement with what Mr Kuckelkorn says in relation to the correlation established between pension systems which cover biometric risks .
We are not talking about systems for financial investment but about pension plans .
On the other hand , we are also in agreement with the participation of workers and the urgent harmonisation of the tax provisions .
Nevertheless , we have to clarify the basic concept of pensions in a way which includes the supplementary pension schemes which cover biometric risks .
It is necessary to clarify , on the other hand , that the single system applies to every type of worker in the European Union ; there are not only workers who work for themselves in the European Union but also many cooperative workers , fortunately .
We must opt for collective systems , but not only company systems - something which is mentioned in the report - but also sectoral ones , taking particular account of SMBs , which have been mentioned by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel .
We must take account of the great difficulties which exist within the Union with regard to the development of supplementary systems .
We therefore understand and support the regulatory and supervisory systems for the protection of the rights of participants , but we must put the emphasis on the areas where systems are still underdeveloped , in aspects such as providing information or implementing new plans .
Finally , I would like to underline our support for the creation of a European pension fund with the participation of the different economic sectors and the pension providers .
Mr President , the ageing of the population and the reduction in the numbers of people of working age , while real enough , have been put forward by the Commission and other Members as a reason to open up the way for pension funds for supplementary pension schemes .
The dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course .
The capitalisation mechanisms mean adapting retirement pensions to the single market and the introduction of the euro .
Moving in this direction entails the risk of a system based on private insurance , which would gradually replace social security .
Welfare and retirement pensions would no longer be rights but would be commodities subject to the laws of the market .
The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets .
A system of this type is very dangerous and deeply unfair as it benefits the richest people , those who can save money , and leaves the poorest with a pittance of a retirement pension .
Mr Kuckelkorn &apos; s initial report considered the retirement pension primarily as social insurance against certain life risks , rather than a process of accumulating capital .
It has been radically changed , however , by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation .
I cannot , therefore , approve this report which makes the Commission &apos; s approach even worse .
On the contrary , we think that a high level of social protection must be maintained , based on solidarity , regardless of financial profitability .
The contributory system guarantees the rights of the employed and provides them with a pension , in the framework of national solidarity between the working population and the retired population , between generations , between men and women , between the public and the private sectors .
The objective should be to obtain new resources and to upgrading the purchasing power of retirement pensions from contributions which could be raised from taxes on financial products at the same level as those which apply to wages .
Employers &apos; contributions should be linked to companies &apos; employment policies and taxes set up on those which make people redundant .
Mr President , as medical advances contribute to a steady ageing of our populations , the burden of pension provision throughout the Union becomes ever more costly .
In the UK , as in the US , Chile and Singapore and , to a lesser extent , the Netherlands , the burden on the state and succeeding generations has been significantly eased through the successful provision of supplementary second and third pillar private and occupational pension schemes , involving funds which grow to provide pension benefits following the retirement of the individuals .
Both pillars have the advantage of being resistant to demographic change , and third-pillar portable schemes , in particular , which are not restricted to single companies , enhance labour mobility and choice for the investors and are much more affordable to small and medium enterprises .
I welcome the fact that there is widespread recognition in this House to extend these supplementary schemes throughout Europe , even if there are disagreements over their precise nature and the way that the funds are to be invested .
The problem needs to be addressed urgently in my opinion , with demographic pressures in recent years already generating deficits in the pay-as-you-go schemes in France , Germany , Italy and Spain .
It is even predicted that if the current trend continues some countries will be facing costs of up to 20 % of their GDP in the next ten years for their pension liabilities .
There are , of course , many risks with equity investments , but there are even greater risks to Europe with stagnant economies .
Growing pension funds will dynamise our economies by providing large additional capital funds for investment not only in the EU , but also in developing markets , with greater prospects for future growth and returns on investment for our pensioners .
In the case of defined contribution schemes , which give the investor a direct stake in the overall health of the national economy , there will also be a sense of participation in the country of that individual .
The state scheme will of course remain the primary mechanism for basic provision in old age .
But personal responsibility and choice will become the watchwords of success if the demographic challenges of the coming century are to be met successfully .
That is why we should not be too prescriptive regarding the issues of biometric risks or investment strategies .
We need a light-touch regulatory framework , with bilateral tax agreements , which will ensure the portability for those EU nationals wishing to work abroad throughout the Union , achieve a genuine single market in financial services and provide maximum choice to the European investor .
Mr President , this report seeks to harmonise supplementary pensions in Europe .
In fact , it seeks nothing less than to open up all European pension schemes to the financial markets .
Indeed , it recommends the development of a truly single pension fund market by referring to the inevitability of resorting to capitalisation .
It should be noted , by the way , that when the financial interests of the most powerful are involved , they are not slow to forget the principle of solidarity and to propose a single model .
This report puts forward cynical arguments and seeks to give credence to the idea that only capitalisation would ensure better protection of low incomes .
The truth is that it is not an attempt to supplement state pension schemes , but rather to gradually empty them of all substance .
Those who are employed know full well , however , that a pension is theirs by right .
They fought for this right , which is based on intergenerational solidarity .
That is why they do not , under any circumstances , want to see their pensions gambled on the stock exchange .
In several countries , powerful social movements have already opposed similar attempts .
Their threats have to this day prevented the French government , for example , from introducing pension funds .
This is in perfect harmony with past , present and future struggles , and it is in support of them that we shall be voting against a report that reduces this Parliament to the level of a lobby for high finance .
Retired people need an adequate , stable and safe pension .
Pension funds and the stock exchange will never be able to guarantee that .
On this issue , as on many others , a choice must be made between increasing the profits of a few or satisfying the needs of all .
Mr President , I would like to start by paying tribute to Mr Kuckelkorn , because he has drafted a courageous report in my opinion , given Germany &apos; s rigid and inflexible pension situation .
He clearly wants to take steps towards developing a European internal market for supplementary pension schemes .
I think he deserves tribute for this .
I myself come from a country where a very extensive second pillar of supplementary pensions exists .
Almost 90 % of the professional population in the private sector are in pension schemes which guarantee a wage-related pension .
This also includes small and medium-sized businesses .
With a capacity of over EUR 150 billion , the pension fund of Dutch civil servants is the largest institutional investor of its kind within the international capital market .
Pension funds in the Netherlands are daring to take increasing risks in their investments .
In 1999 , nearly half of the pension money was invested in shares , albeit under strict prudential conditions .
But the average return over the past five years has been around 15 % , instead of the usual 4 % .
It has been shown that it is precisely the compulsory nature of participation in collective pension funds which encourages these excellent results .
The fact that funds are spread over generations and risks means that the funds can invest in shares to such a high level .
On balance , this yields a far better return for individual members , much better than they could ever achieve on their own via a savings plan or investment fund .
Therefore , I must open Mrs Kauppi &apos; s eyes and disprove her reasoning that individual workers would be better off making their own choices , even if they belong to the fortunate ones who do not have any hereditary diseases , who are young and male , because , unfortunately , Mrs Kauppi , we women are even worse off under individual schemes as we live longer than men on average .
Consequently , I would strongly discourage you from formulating a principle of free choice at European level .
If I were you , I would leave this to the Member States and the free market .
As for biometric risks , other speakers have already talked enough about this .
I fully endorse Mr Kuckelkorn in this respect and would argue that such a definition is very important because we are expecting a number of additional directives from the European Commission .
Mr President , we are voting against this report advocating self-funded pension schemes .
This system restricts employees who want to guarantee a retirement pension for themselves that will give them enough to live on , to make their money available to investment funds , trusts , insurance companies or other private financial groups .
At the same time , it makes the value of pensions subordinate to the financial markets , in other words , to speculation .
What is more , all those whose salaries are too low for them to be able to pay into a pension fund will be entitled only to a very meagre pension .
Referring to demographic changes in order to justify this is a swindle .
Productivity has increased tenfold in the last fifty years and if company owners and shareholders had not transformed the fruits of this productivity into purely private profit , it would now enable salaries to be higher and would guarantee appropriate pensions for everyone .
If contributory pension schemes are having problems , it is only because there are fewer employed people in proportion to the number of retired people , because there are too many unemployed and because salaries are too low .
So , if there is a shortfall in pension funds , States should take over by deducting the necessary amounts from the profits of industrial and financial groups .
Mr President , the ageing of the European population means that we will have huge problems when it comes to footing the bill for our statutory pension schemes .
Member States where supplementary schemes are under-developed compared to statutory pension schemes will feel the pinch most .
Unfortunately , we are forced to note that this is the case for the majority of Member States .
A developed collective system of supplementary pensions , compulsory if so required by the relevant Member State , considerably reduces the dependence on demographic factors and enables the pension fund , in the role of investor , to derive maximum benefit from the possibilities which financial markets have to offer .
Needless to say , the objective of making employees more mobile and flexible within a large single European market and the euro zone will inevitably lead to interest in supplementary pension schemes .
One of the philosophies underlying the European Union and the Monetary Union requires that the internal market should be used to the full .
As such , you , as a worker , should be able to take your accumulated pension rights with you to another European country .
To this end , we need to develop a legal framework at European level at the earliest opportunity .
Why should a German employee , for example , have to wait ten years before he has built up a pension and a Dutch person only one year ?
As such , this German person suffers a considerable handicap with regard to mobility .
What is more , the fiscal treatment of pensions at the time when contributions are made and at the time of payout should be brought into line .
Commissioner , you deal with taxes , what is the latest on this score ?
I have to say that this parliamentary discussion seems to be more about a complete harmonisation than coordination .
This , unfortunately , is at the expense of Member States which already have their house in order .
One such country is the Netherlands , initially presented as a role model for all other Member States and gradually relegated to curiosity status .
But the Dutch system is a worthy system which accepts old age , surviving dependants and vulnerable groups within the labour market as they are .
The supplementary pension scheme is based on collective feeling and solidarity .
This enables SMBs - and specifically SMBs with reference to the UK MEPs - to cover biometric risks at relatively low cost .
Top of the list are payability and security , which is not the case for the proposals submitted by some MEPs .
Mr Bolkestein , how do you intend to bring the discussion back to the crux of the matter , namely mobile pensions for mobile people ?
Mr President , firstly can I say that the EMAC report is pretty good and I hope we do not amend it too much .
The key word is &quot; supplementary &quot; pensions .
We are not trying to relieve poverty or provide a basic income in retirement .
The second point is that it is important that we provide decent pensions to enable citizens to move around Europe .
So I welcome the emphasis on removing the restrictions on the investment of pension fund portfolios and support the objective of removing barriers to labour mobility .
The key is to keep it simple or it will not work , it will not remove the obstacles .
As Mr Tannock has said , there are demographic pressures upon us and it is in our interest to facilitate the development of supplementary pension schemes both around Europe and also in many countries within Europe .
On the issue of biometric risks , which we have heard a lot about , clearly a pension by definition has one biometric risk , which is longevity .
Once you start building on top of that , you are on dangerous ground if you make it a condition of a passport .
What we need is to have a very simple proposition , and then let the market sort the rest of it out because that is what the market is for .
The biometric risks problem means many different things to different people .
We must try and get a simple product which is marketable and can be moved around this market , because if we do not , we will end up with a product that does not work at all that the different Member States cannot make use of .
So the key is to keep it simple and make it work .
Mr President , for how long will workers be forced to sacrifice one-third of their salary to government and state pension funds , in the hope of receiving a pension in their old age , while those government and state funds are so designed that they make pensions vanish faster than Houdini himself could have done ?
Mrs Laguiller , the people trusted the states and the governments , especially the pledges made by left-wing governments , but they have been left with peanuts .
Every day , thousands upon thousands of elderly people reach retirement age and ask their governments , &quot; Where are our pensions ? &quot; And the governments reply , &quot; You are living too long and there is no more money left to give you &quot; , concealing the truth .
And what is the truth ?
The governments have squandered the funds and made off with the workers &apos; salaries .
Shame on the Socialist governments for failing to provide for workers in their old age !
Despite the fact that there may now be a way of safeguarding this capital - the sweat of the brows of the workers - by capitalising pension funds , we are told that we must not do this , because the national governments want to get their hands on private pension funds as well .
It is time to change the tune.We must give to Caesar what is Caesar &apos; s and to God what is God &apos; s .
Mr President , we are facing a difficult issue , as evidenced by the large number of speakers .
I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Kuckelkorn as rapporteur , for the huge effort he has made to achieve this report .
I am slightly less pleased with Mr Kuckelkorn &apos; s tabling of amendments , because he has tabled a great many and they go beyond the requirements of the current objective .
I think that we should differentiate between the two Kuckelkorns .
I believe that the systems we should pursue in Europe should be based on two principles .
One of them is simply the statutory pay-as-you-go system and the other is the system of capital cover which is an extension of the former , it is just that the only problem we are facing is that all countries have very different starting positions .
It is true that a country such as the Netherlands has managed to strike a fine balance between the two.Other countries have managed to do this to a lesser extent .
Also , for example , countries where nearly all pensions are capital cover systems , such as Great Britain , do not meet expectations because , although the risks for the government are reasonably small , the cover for the retired is extremely modest .
In England , if there is a hard frost , for example , people are unable to pay their bills .
I do not think that this is the right way forward .
First and foremost , we need to remember that this is about people and based on this , we must develop a system which makes sound pension schemes possible , and we must , as far as we can , leave this task to the Member States .
We should keep intervention to a minimum .
We need to bear our starting point in mind , namely that if people move from one country to another to work or retire , it should be possible for them to take their pensions with them .
The Commission has always attempted to do this and I do believe that it has succeeded in its aim .
I think that two issues still need tackling .
Firstly , risks tied in with the second and third pillars should be sufficiently covered , because far too little has been said about this .
Secondly , the first pillar should at long last be defined , as the first pillar in one country is quite different from that in another country .
And if we could bring all of this a bit closer together , we would perhaps have far fewer problems than we have at the moment .
Mr President , may I start by extending warm thanks to both rapporteurs , Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn , for the reports they have drafted and the efforts they have made .
In fact , could I also warmly thank all other speakers this evening - nearly thirty of them - for the comments they have made and questions they have asked .
This is an important matter , both the action plan for financial services and the pension issue , and it is heartening to see so many speakers take part in the exchange of opinions .
As far as Mr García-Margallo y Marfil &apos; s report is concerned , I would like to note that , according to the Commission , it is an even-handed report which strikes the right balance between an important political vision and the technical measures required in order to make progress .
Perhaps you will allow me to make a few observations in this respect.I hope , at the same time , to comment on the amendments which have been tabled .
The Commission welcomes the attention which the report pays to the need for capital markets to function to optimum effect .
In this context , I would also refer to Parliament &apos; s request for streamlined rules for stock market access , market manipulation and revision of the investment services directive .
The opening up of financial markets should , naturally , go hand in hand with an adequate level of consumer protection , and this was also requested this evening in this debate .
They are thus parallel processes , with liberalisation on one side and consumer protection on the other , and these are the two objectives which you will find wherever financial markets are at issue .
These are the European Commission &apos; s twin objectives .
We also have a few specific proposals in this respect .
Firstly , we would propose the provision of better information on financial products for citizens .
Secondly , we would like to see better and clearer dispute procedures for citizens who are dissatisfied with foreign financial dealers .
Thirdly , we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules .
The fourth proposal concerns electronic commerce , or e-commerce for short .
Policy and legislation should make provision for e-commerce without creating unnecessary barriers .
Our citizens , on the other hand , must experience the same level of confidence and protection for transactions on-line as they do off-line .
Finally , an adequate supervisory structure is essential to guarantee the financial solvency of our institutions .
Does this mean that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will be given a central supervisory role ?
The ECB itself is of the opinion that this is not necessary .
There is in fact an alternative , to wit , a coming together of supervisory systems .
At this juncture , Mr President , I would like to bring up a remark made by Mrs Randzio-Plath .
It is an important remark .
Mrs Randzio-Plath has picked up some noises from the OECD and mentioned the word mega-risk .
Indeed , I think she is right to indicate the risks which can be inherent in financial movements .
She has referred to large mergers which are taking place and , without necessarily sharing her view regarding these risks , I would also like to refer to statements made by Mr Lamfalussi , who is well-known within the European financial system , and who has also indicated the need to be able to cope adequately with the financial risks and system risks which are heading our way .
This is a very important matter .
I still believe that coordination , cooperation and harmonisation of supervisory systems are enough to withstand the risks , but , once again , in the interest of the case itself , I would like to draw the attention of Mrs Randzio-Plath and other members of this meeting to a report recently drafted by Mr Brouwer , second-in-command at the Central Bank in the Netherlands.This report was commissioned by the Economic and Financial Committee , which , as you are aware , is the gateway to the ECOFIN Council , and the report deals with financial stability .
The report will be made available shortly .
No doubt you will be able to find it on the Internet.This report deals with the issue which is close to Mrs Randzio-Plath &apos; s heart and once again , I would strongly recommend all members attending this meeting to read it .
Well , most of the points I mentioned a moment ago can be found in the draft report of the rapporteur , Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , and also in many of the tabled amendments .
In sum , I would like to say that we will undoubtedly continue to discuss the nuts and bolts but as far as the main points are concerned , I do consider Mr García-Margallo y Marfil &apos; s report as welcome confirmation of the Commission &apos; s vision .
I would now like to say a few words on the way in which a number of these measures need to be implemented , the need to take a close look at our legislative ethos and the way in which legislation is established .
Everyone is currently in agreement that we need to drop over-complicated , fossilised legislation , in other words , rules which cannot keep pace with fast market development .
Accordingly , the process by which the European Union , i.e. the concerted efforts of Commission , Parliament and Council , lays down rules should be quicker .
But how exactly can this be done ?
There are quite a few different ideas and quite a few misconceptions , because if Mr García-Margallo y Marfil tells me that the European Parliament does not want to give up any of the powers it has only recently acquired , then I naturally share his view .
I myself have been a Member of Parliament for a long time , so I fully understand where Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is coming from .
In fact , this is not the Commission &apos; s intention , even if it was authorised to take decisions in this respect , which is not the case .
Nonetheless , we need to proceed faster in order to lay down the necessary rules .
I would invite the Members of this Parliament to come up with any ideas as to how we could speed up and enhance the process .
Should we make more use of comitology procedures ?
Should more weight be given to agreement reached between the institutions upon first reading ?
At any rate , the Commission intends to keep Parliament and the competent committees informed of the agendas more quickly and more effectively , so that these agendas can be better harmonised and we can speed up the drafting of the required legislation .
In any event , I would like to keep this Parliament informed of all the developments regarding the action plan.Every six months , we send a progress report to the ECOFIN Council and it seems to me that these reports could be used to exchange views with Parliament on this matter .
Mr President , most speakers have expressed their thoughts on the issue of pensions and I would like to say the following on this matter .
In its communication on pensions , the Commission has included proposals on three fronts .
The first area is prudential rules for pension funds , and protecting pension scheme members should take centre stage .
There is no question that rules could be introduced which could threaten the rights of future pensioners .
This is beyond dispute .
However , this does not detract from the fact that investment and management rules can also serve the interests of people other than pension scheme members .
In fact futile provisions that inhibit the results of investments , do pension scheme members no favours and must be repealed for this reason .
Secondly , the coordination of national tax systems is a condition for cross-border participation .
Mrs Peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people ?
Other Members too , such as Mr von Wogau and others , have talked about the need to enhance the mobility of workers within the European Union .
As already stated , this does not require harmonisation ( a word we need to use with discretion because it conjures up incorrect associations in certain Member States ) so much as coordination .
So it requires the coordination of tax systems which differ in terms of tariffs .
This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility .
The Commission is in the process of drafting a proposal , a general framework , intended to facilitate the payment of contributions by occupational pension institutions which are located in other Member States .
This general framework has also been requested , of course , in this meeting by Mr Medina Ortega , for example , while Mrs Peijs has also indicated the need to set up this general framework .
Moreover , I would like to refer to the constant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice .
This jurisprudence has demonstrated that the restrictions which apply to cross-border contributions and premiums are at odds with the Treaty .
The Commission &apos; s third objective is to remove the obstacles which migrant workers are faced with .
More than anything , and this is also underlined in the draft report - rightly so - we should facilitate the transferability of rights from one Member State to another , and this is also very much in the interests of employee mobility , of course .
Mr President , concerning the motion for a resolution , I would first of all like to remark that this Parliament &apos; s support is crucially important if we want to translate these proposals into specific measures .
It was with great interest that I read the sterling report of the rapporteur , Mr Kuckelkorn , and the competent committees , a report that so far has covered an extensive and technically complex area .
I did not fail to notice that Parliament is backing the lines of policy proposed by the Commission .
With regard to the motion for a resolution , I would like to make the following brief comments .
The motion presses for the general introduction of the tax levy model that relies on the taxation of the pension payout whilst providing for tax exemption for contributions to the fund and returns on the fund.The desirability of this model was once again underlined this evening by Mr Blokland , among others .
Mr Blokland pointed this out and I share his view on this .
This is also echoed in the motion for a resolution .
Agreement on this approach would solve the problems of either double taxation or no taxation , which is what citizens and Member States are struggling with at the moment .
However , I would like to point out that this issue , as is known , only and exclusively concerns the competences of the Member States and , as such , falls outside the scope of the European Commission .
The Commission should ensure , however , if different systems continue to coexist in future too , that this does not have any adverse effects on workers exercising their right to mobility within the Union .
Regarding the amendments tabled , I would like to stress one point in particular , namely the scope of the future proposal - as the directive is not yet finished - for a directive regulating the activities of occupational pension funds .
In other words , the question is , and many Members attending this evening &apos; s meeting have spoken about this , Mrs Kauppi , in particular : should this proposal , which we are about to disclose , provide for all forms of pension schemes or should it simply be restricted to pension scheme products which cover the members against biometric risks ?
My answer to this is as follows , I hope it is clear : we need European prudential standards for all forms of occupational pension schemes .
These standards will differ in certain aspects according to the risks actually covered by the institutions .
But there is not one single technical reason why these different types of savings schemes could not be combined in one and the same directive .
It would , in my view , be incorrect - and the European Union would impose artificial restrictions on itself - if the Commission were to restrict the directive to be proposed to pension schemes which only cover biometric risks and if it were to exclude other pension provisions which , although they are full pension provisions because they cannot be collected before pensionable age , should nonetheless still be excluded from the directive , according to a number of delegates .
I believe that this is not right .
I think that the European Union would not do itself any favours if the subject of the directive were to be limited to biometric risks and I can honestly see no reason why other forms of pension schemes could not be included in the same directive , as I pointed out a moment ago .
Well now , Member States are thus given every opportunity to give certain pension products preferential treatment by using tax incentive measures , for example .
They can also demand that the products offered on their market , even if the institutions offering the service are based in another Member State , meet certain social criteria .
Employees and employers within one company or one sector are free to choose , according to the benefits and drawbacks of the products available on their market .
In other words , there is still a large degree of freedom for the Member States to arrange the pension systems within their own country as they see fit .
This freedom remains .
The Commission &apos; s ambition is to create , I repeat , one framework which liberalises the setting up and scope of pension funds for the benefit of all the members of such pension funds .
Accordingly , we need to set up this legal framework within the European Union which enables businesses and future pensioners to choose the products on offer within a transparent market by institutions which are adequately supervised .
Adequate supervision is crucial , as is liberalising the scope of pension funds .
It is not up to the Commission to specify a pension product in every detail.Indeed this is a matter which falls under the subsidiarity principle , and the European Commission would not wish to do anything which could compromise this principle .
Mr President , I would like to ask the Commissioner if he could also reply to my question .
I have been waiting for a reply for one and a half hours now .
I would , at long last , like to have a response to my question on cash management and the solution to this problem which is particularly hitting small and medium-sized businesses .
Mr President , I would prefer to address Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel &apos; s issue when I respond to the report on the internal market .
This would , however , mean that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would have to stay even longer at this meeting .
This is not such a bad thing , in my opinion .
In the final analysis , many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , but since she has reminded me of this question , which , as I have already said , I would have addressed at a later stage , let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market .
It is true that small and medium-sized businesses are facing obstacles in their cross-border activities .
The Commission is acutely aware of this .
Needless to say , the scope of the internal market is intended to facilitate cross-border activities for small and medium-sized businesses .
The new strategy for the internal market comprises one hundred or so measures , many of which will be beneficial to small and medium-sized businesses .
But if Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would like to approach me with specific problems relating to small and medium-sized businesses which are not covered in the new strategy for the internal market , I shall make every effort to address these points to her satisfaction .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Strategy for Europe &apos; s Internal Market
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0098 / 2000 ) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council : The Strategy for Europe &apos; s Internal Market &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 464 - C5-0212 / 1999 - 1999 / 2167 ( COS ) &#93;
Mr President , Commissioner , the report which I have the honour to present is the result of an extraordinary collaboration - which I am grateful for - between people and committees .
Allow me to make two observations : the Committee on Legal Affairs has not accepted all the suggestions of the committee asked for an opinion .
We were in complete agreement with most of them and they seemed to us to be very interesting , but we consider that this resolution was not the right place for them and that , by incorporating them , its message would be less clearly expressed .
That has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this House .
I therefore insist - and the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries is a good example of this - that they have not been included in the resolution , not because I reject their content , but because the message in relation to the internal market strategy had to be clearly expressed .
What was that message ?
That message stems from the position adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs in our resolution of 4 November 1999 .
If you will allow me , Mr President , I will concentrate on three ideas .
The first concern of the Committee on Legal Affairs -and I hope this House will ratify it tomorrow - is the concept of the situation of the internal market .
What does the internal market mean to European construction ?
These days we hear the siren song of globalisation and together with that goes the idea that we are international .
The internal market appears to have become very small in this new globalised economy .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
This document on the strategy for the internal market expresses this very clearly .
The internal market is Europe &apos; s platform in the world .
The internal market embodies the key principles of a globalised economy with advantages for Europe in terms of competition .
That is the first message of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
We need to put the emphasis on the principles of the internal market : the principle of proportionality , the principle of mutual recognition , the principle of control of origin .
These must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built .
We will not make the headlines with this , but it is important nonetheless .
The application and control of Community legislation is also important.The Member States must cooperate in this application .
We must oppose procedures which are used too frequently , such as &apos; gold plating &apos; .
We need to strengthen our infringement procedure , we need to consolidate it , make it more transparent and more accessible .
We ask that decisions on the outcome of infringement proceedings be explained and that Parliament be informed of them .
We ask that infringement cases be processed more quickly and that they be more effectively presented to the citizen .
The second message of this resolution is that we need to make the present , rather disorganised laws , which the citizens see as a burden , into a genuine legislation , a coherent and clear framework of rules and regulations , without any overlapping or contradictions .
These contradictions are seen by the citizen and by industry as burdens , as a lack of clarity in the message regarding the direction we are taking .
Lastly , the third message is a change in the business culture in Europe .
We need businesspeople who are more willing to take risks .
To this end we will have to change certain laws , such as for example the European laws on insolvency in general , on the suspension of payments and bankruptcy .
We need to put the emphasis on the creation of a genuine capital risk market .
We need to convince young Europeans , as young Americans are already convinced , that the best option is not to join a large company , on a long-term basis , but to create new companies .
In all of this , electronic commerce , the Internet and new technologies must offer a good platform .
Finally , Mr President , to sum up , I hope that tomorrow , on voting for the resolution , Parliament will send a clear message .
We are behind the Commission in this initiative and of course we want to participate in the whole process , permanently , cooperating , offering ideas and monitoring the situation .
Mr President , once again the European Parliament must express its opinion on the Commission communication on the construction of the internal market , in this case , a new version of it .
A proportion of its content affects the competences of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
It is these points which I wish to discuss specifically .
Firstly , I would like to say that , in general , one of the criticisms levelled at previous versions of this documents no longer applies .
The European Parliament &apos; s resolution of 4 November 1999 said that the document was rather unspecific , that it did not contain specific actions .
This new version does contain specific measures and proposals .
Let us then analyse the content of these proposals , albeit in general terms .
With regard to taxation , the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is that the Communication is not ambitious enough , especially when compared to previous documents .
We are aware of the stumbling blocks encountered in relation to the tax package and that some of its chapters have been blocked , but in situations such as this large doses of political courage are necessary to push proposals forward .
We notice a lack of such political courage in this document since the chapter on tax simply reproduces previous Commission commitments , and even leaves aside some of the European Parliament &apos; s proposals .
Secondly , in relation to the rules on competition , the Communication opts for deepening the process of reform underway , and this deserves our support .
Finally , in the chapter on financial services , it should be highlighted that up to now important progress has been made but , as indicated in the recent single market scoreboard , there is still a lot to be done .
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , it is natural that I should speak about the problems which the strategy for developing the internal market may pose from a social point of view .
We are starting with a European social model - which is a national model - and we are transforming the economic structure of that society .
In doing so , we are concerned that the effort to liberalise should not transform the essence of the current European social model .
An example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport .
If urban transport is not subjected to political considerations and the intervention of local authorities , for example , straightforward liberalisation could make it practically impossible for us to reach our workplaces .
We have had examples such as the case of Venezuela where a strictly private system of public transport led to a profound social and political crisis in that country .
Liberalisation presents other difficulties .
For example , when public services and public companies are privatised and those public companies come to be controlled by a private sector which in reality replaces the state monopoly with a private monopoly , liberalisation may not come about effectively at all .
Liberalisation by means of privatising public companies may end up consolidating dominant positions and private monopolies which in my opinion may offer fewer benefits than a monopoly conceived in the public interest .
Another aspect - which we referred to in the recent debate on the Kuckelkorn report - is the need to coordinate social protection .
Social protection in a single internal market cannot simply be left to subsidiarity .
Lastly , cohesion also seems to me to be important .
If there is no economic and social cohesion , if we do not balance the quality of life in the different regions of the Community , we may find ourselves in a situation where the European Union is an unfair European Union in which some regions will make more progress and others will be left behind .
This is the basis of the amendments which Mrs Berger and I are presenting , representing the views of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
- ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would thank the rapporteur for explicitly mentioning the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries , although we regret that it has not been included in the report .
I say this especially , Commissioner , so that you can communicate to the Commission , and particularly to Mr Fischler , the fact that the common fisheries policy is one of the few areas of Community activity where until now very few steps have been taken in the creation of a genuine internal market .
The lack of action is related to the original conception of this policy .
The current Council Regulation No 3760 / 92 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture , provides for derogations in respect of the internal market , notably in Articles 6 and 7 , which allow derogations from the principle of freedom of access to fishing grounds , so that Member States have the right of exclusive exploitation of their fisheries resources within a 12-mile coastal band , as well as a series of preferential fishing rights , through application of the &apos; relative stability &apos; principle , which distributes national fishing quotas .
At the same time it lays down restrictions on exercising fishing activities in certain areas known as &apos; boxes &apos; .
These restrictions on the principle of freedom of action , which were originally intended to be temporary restrictions , have been extended and will be in force until 1 January 2003 as a mechanism to allow certain Member States &apos; fishing industries to adapt to the rules of free competition in an increasingly open and globalised market .
Over 20 years have passed and , as we are about to embark upon a general review of all aspects of the common fisheries policy which , for compelling legal reasons , must take place in 2002 , it is now time , I believe , to examine whether the transitional period for adaptation to free competition provided for in the said regulation should be ended .
In my opinion , the fishing industry and the common fisheries policy should also be subject to derogations in respect of the internal market .
Therefore , the principles and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties should also be applied to fisheries , in other words , the framework of the common fisheries policy should be brought into line with the general legal framework of Community legislation .
Mr President , on behalf of our Group I should like to warmly welcome Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi &apos; s excellent report .
As she said in her introduction , she has made the very wise decision to focus on what are the most critical issues for the creation of the single market .
I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes .
The first one is the need to address , within the Union , the impact of legislation on business .
It is particularly important that we ask the Commission to reinforce its activities , to ensure proper compliance cost assessment and to assess the costs on businesses of the new legislation .
I say to the Commissioner that we do not expect this to be done as an after-thought , after all the departments in the Commission have developed legislation .
It needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process .
He must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward .
We were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at Lisbon .
Our committee and , indeed , our Group has been emphasising , since this new Parliament started last year , the need to encourage the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises across the European Union .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi &apos; s report emphasises a number of key points such as the need to make business formation cheaper and quicker and the need to remove some of the barriers preventing entrepreneurs from benefiting from the risks of putting capital into starting up new businesses .
I am disappointed to see that our Socialist colleagues are proposing that clause should be taken out of this resolution .
I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow .
I invite colleagues to reject that proposal .
I conclude by confirming that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market .
I give credit to all our colleagues , across all political groups , for the speed with which we have dealt with the electronic commerce directive this week .
I hope that is appreciated .
I hope it will demonstrate that we are prepared to work with speed .
I hope that , together , we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I feel nothing but appreciation for Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi &apos; s clear draft report .
It concisely outlines and highlights the key points from the Commission &apos; s communication on the strategy to be followed for Europe &apos; s internal market .
I would like to highlight some of these points .
The promised dialogue between the Commission on the one hand and business and citizens on the other is to be welcomed because the relationship between the Commission , the European Parliament and society should , after all , be interactive .
In order to keep pace with the present breakneck speed at which technology is developing , it is not only desirable but essential to keep the dialogue going .
So far , the average citizen has had insufficient insight into what drives the Union and what can be gained from European cooperation .
This is why information campaigns are essential.After all , Europe cannot afford to remain a remote spectacle .
Back to basics should be our motto .
The e-Europe initiative praises the use and expertise of Internet and multimedia .
This is very commendable indeed but , rather than just creating a frame , it is more important to give substance to education .
I would like to repeat the words of the French President spoken at the official opening of this Parliament building and I quote : &quot; We must create a citizens &apos; Europe in which each individual gradually comes to see that he or she has a role to play .
We have a duty to build this great common house in which each individual nevertheless feels at home.A house in which everyone lives together , in a spirit of solidarity , but in which each individual retains his or her identity &quot; .
In order to meet these objectives , the residents need to get to know and get a feel for their house , or rather their home .
In order to build a genuine internal market , we should , more than anything , concentrate on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized businesses .
To this day , there are still too many obstacles .
Companies &apos; competitiveness and dynamism depend directly on a regulating climate which is conducive to investment , innovation and entrepreneurship .
Finally , I can only echo the need for SLIM .
Legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language .
Superfluous legislation should be withdrawn .
It would therefore be beneficial to draw up a scoreboard of laws which have been abolished .
Mr President , I would like to speak on a point of order .
During the debate , Mr Harbour referred to an amendment tabled on behalf of Mrs Berger and myself - Amendment No 2 , paragraph 22 ( 2 ) .
If I am not mistaken , Mr Harbour said that he was opposed to our amendment .
I believe that there has been a little confusion .
In the Spanish version which I have there is no problem .
The amendment is based on the German text , which causes some concern because it refers to the issue of share options .
I imagine that in the English text which Mr Harbour has there is no problem either .
The Spanish text simply says &quot; remove the barriers imposed on entrepreneurs capitalising on company value through the issue of share options on the stock exchange &quot; .
If this is the correct text , there is really no problem , in which case I would withdraw that amendment and simply ask for the German version to be adapted to what is said in the Spanish text .
Mr President , many thanks for giving me the floor regarding an issue which is very dear to the Commission as a whole and myself , in particular , namely the new strategy for the internal market .
To begin with , I would like to extend my warm thanks to Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for the ardent support she has shown for the set of measures proposed by the Commission .
The Commission feels confirmed in its intention thanks to this important vote of confidence coming from this Parliament .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has mentioned three topics .
First of all , she stressed the importance of the internal market as a forum in the world , which is essential for the competitiveness of European industry and the European service industry , and she is absolutely right , of course .
This is , in fact , echoed in Mrs Berger &apos; s remarks , who stated that the internal market is not an old hat one can simply take off , the internal market is and will remain essential to European competitiveness as a forum in the world .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi &apos; s second remark highlights a number of inconsistencies .
According to her , sometimes one does not know where one stands .
This would be a serious shortcoming if it were true to this extent .
Needless to say , the Commission attempts to establish internal consistency between rules , but it is , of course , possible for rules to be in conflict with one another in certain areas.If this were the case , then the Commission would be more than happy to rectify this situation .
I would like to thank Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and the other Members for their comments regarding specific inconsistencies between rules.This will enable the Commission to do something about this .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi &apos; s third remark concerns the change in culture .
This is an important yet very difficult topic , which predominantly refers to the availability of risk capital , as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has also pointed out .
There happen to be bankers in the risk capital industry who believe that Europe has the money but lacks the entrepreneurs .
In other words , according to these bankers I spoke to recently , the bottleneck is not so much due to the availability of capital as to the availability of entrepreneurs.This is tied in with the economic culture .
I happen to disagree with these critics .
Responsibility lies with both camps .
The bottleneck is the result of both the availability of risk capital , especially the cost of risk capital , but we are also , of course , lacking the sufficient entrepreneurship .
This is down to Europe &apos; s economic culture which still instils in us the belief that bankruptcy will stay with a young entrepreneur for a long time , while in the United States , as everyone knows , bankruptcy is taken far more lightly .
I hence agree with Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi that something needs to be done to breathe new life into Europe &apos; s entrepreneurial culture .
Moreover , I suspect that in the light of developments , which are termed the &quot; new economy &quot; , an increasing number of , mainly , young people , young entrepreneurs , will be encouraged to start up a business .
After having expressed my thanks once again to the rapporteur , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , I would now like to move on to remarks made by Mr Berenguer Fuster .
According to him , the Commission should have more political courage , especially in the fiscal domain .
My response to Mr Berenguer Fuster is : should the Commission have yet more political courage ?
What the Commission is trying to bring about is already so hard to achieve .
That does not just pertain to the topic that was under discussion earlier this evening , namely the coordination of taxes and tax legislation regarding pension contributions .
It also concerns the taxation package formulated by my predecessor , Mr Monti .
Moreover , during the discussion of the previous topic , Mr Lipietz remarked that he , and probably his group too , is not prepared to further liberalise the provision of financial services if the package , also known as the Monti package , is not adopted .
I would like to oppose such reasoning which has no foundations in the real world .
It would be an example of cutting off your nose to spite your face , if Parliament or the Commission were to say that they refuse to make further attempts to integrate the financial services if no progress were made in terms of the taxation package .
This would not be the right attitude , in my opinion .
Although Mr Berenguer Fuster has not said this in so many words of course , I would still like to take the opportunity to stress this point .
I ask Mr Berenguer Fuster if he would like the Commission to have yet more political courage ?
We are already struggling to achieve what we have proposed .
I would like to see the Commission achieve what it has proposed to do first and then take it from there .
Mr Berenguer Fuster has also said that a great deal still needs to be done in the field of financial services .
And he is right , of course .
Mr Berenguer Fuster is undoubtedly familiar with the action plan for financial services which was adopted on 13 May 1999 and which includes 43 objectives .
We are in the process of achieving these , at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year .
I am hoping , on behalf of the Commission , to make certain proposals regarding pensions , for example - we discussed this topic a moment ago - but also regarding the opening up of markets for postal services , regarding the public provision of goods and services , public tendering etc . , before the summer recess .
We are truly active in the field which is dear to Mr Berenguer Fuster .
I would now like to comment on a remark made by Mr Medina Ortega .
He said that at present , there is a risk of state monopolies being replaced by private monopolies .
I would like to assure Mr Medina Ortega that this is , of course , by no means the intention .
Replacing a state monopoly by a private monopoly only makes matters worse .
This is certainly not the intention of this Commission .
What the Commission does intend to do , however , is to add substance to the decisions taken by the European Council at Lisbon , namely to free up the markets for gas , electricity , transport and postal services a lot faster .
The Commission is trying to flesh this out and this also means that those state monopolies need to allow for more competition in the fields I mentioned a moment ago .
But , I repeat , the prospect of replacing state monopolies by private monopolies is something which we do not exactly relish .
I would then like to come back to the remarks made by Mr Harbour , who , like Mr Beysen and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , was absolutely right to highlight the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and the costs related to running these businesses .
The Commission is aware that , for example , the costs involved in establishing a business or a small business over here far outstrip the costs in the United States .
To give you an idea of the cost difference , it takes an average of five days to set up a small or medium-sized business in the United States .
In Europe it takes far longer , even as long as five months , a ratio of 1 in 30 .
This is , of course , directly reflected in the cost .
If we then talk about culture , and I am addressing Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi once again , we need to try to do something about these establishment costs of small businesses very quickly , because otherwise we will naturally come off second-best in the competitive battle with North America .
Finally , I would like to turn to Mrs Berger as I have already responded to Mr Beysen &apos; s remarks concerning small and medium-sized businesses .
I have quoted what Mrs Berger said earlier about the hat which you cannot simply take off .
I like this metaphor because it is true that European citizens have the feeling that this internal market is already in place.They take it for granted and do not give it any further thought .
This could not be further from the truth .
The internal market is far from complete .
We must - and the Commission does , in fact - work on it week in week out and defend it , because the internal market is subject to constant pressure , and the Member States fall back into old , protectionist habits which we need to fight .
Mrs Berger was right to refer to directives which remain in the Council .
We are all familiar with examples of directives which remain in a vacuum for five , ten or even fifteen years because they are not adopted by the Council .
Let us hope that this will change .
If you will allow me to highlight one aspect of it : we all hope , of course , that the difference of opinion which is keeping Spain and the United Kingdom divided over a well-known rock in the Southern half of this continent , will now be resolved .
I read in an article in a Spanish newspaper that the issue is moving in the right direction.This would actually unblock half a dozen directives .
We are all waiting for this moment .
To sum up , on the subject of Echelon , I can assure Mrs Berger that this is completely unrelated to the internal market and does not form any threat to it whatsoever .
Mr President , this concludes my remarks .
Could I once again express my appreciation to the Members of Parliament and the rapporteur , in particular , for the important vote of confidence which we received from Parliament regarding the new strategy for the internal market ?
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
2001 : European Year of Languages
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0099 / 2000 ) by Mr Graça Moura , on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision : European Year of Languages 2001 &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 485 - C5-0278 / 1999 - 1999 / 0208 ( COD ) &#93;
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura for a splendid piece of work and for the energy he has put into drawing up this report.I should also like to thank the Council for being so accommodating and the Commission for the role it has played as mediator , especially just recently .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support initiatives which may create greater awareness of the value of linguistic diversity in the European Union .
It is important that the EU &apos; s citizens should be encouraged to learn foreign languages early on in school and also throughout their lives .
A knowledge of languages is important , for European languages are of great significance to European culture and civilisation , and people need good language skills in order to be able to find employment in EU countries other than their own .
The programme for the European Year of Languages offers a splendid basis for providing information about the many different opportunities there are for learning foreign languages , and it is important .
Mr Graça Moura &apos; s proposal includes the 11 official EU languages , together with a number of other languages recognised by the Member States , including Irish and Luxembourgish .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party also thinks that the programme should include other languages which are actually used in the various Member States , for instance Catalan in Spain and Frisian in the Netherlands .
Finally , in the programme for the European Year of Languages , consideration is also given to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , something which we in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party consider to be crucial to all EU programmes .
On behalf of the Group , I can recommend supporting this programme .
Mr President , needless to say , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent and exquisite work .
I would like to make a few minor observations regarding a European campaign which intends to teach Europeans languages from other communities .
We are all convinced of the usefulness of this exercise , of course .
But the thing that often goes wrong with European campaigns - and fortunately I have not been around long enough as a politician to be unaware how the ordinary citizen reacts to this - is that , very often , they are nothing but an attractive front , pretty to look at but insubstantial .
I would therefore like to think that this campaign will offer something different , and that , more importantly , consideration will be given to why it is so hard for people in Europe to learn languages , and at what stages in their lives they are able to learn languages .
I come from a bilingual country myself and I have met some people in that country who never learn the other language , despite the fact that they attend language classes , sometimes for twelve years , and are still unable to speak another language .
This is a terrible observation to have to make .
I therefore hope that in the course of this year of European languages , research will be carried out into the best language teaching methods and , more than anything , how Europeans can be encouraged to learn the language of the other Europeans using a modern and appealing method .
Mr President , after I too have congratulated the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , who has done such a good job that it won the unanimous support of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , I would like to focus my attention on just one point , namely that in addition to the human , cultural and political advantages , the need to learn more than one language is also of considerable economic benefit .
The report also highlights the findings of all the experts : having a good command of one &apos; s mother tongue and learning classical languages , especially Latin and classical Greek , makes it easier to learn other languages .
I would also add our own mother tongue to the equation .
This great truth emerges from a fact rather unknown to most , that in the English language , for example , there are at least 75 000 words of Greek origin .
I repeat , 75 000 English words derive from classical Greek .
There are a similar number of words in the French language that derive from Greek , and the same is true of most other modern European languages .
It is also certain that Latin is just as important for most European languages .
The English sage , Francis Bacon , said that knowledge is power , so knowledge of the basic languages from which our modern European languages derive improves our general knowledge and reinforces European civilisation , which , besides its humanitarian value , is also a weapon for our survival and prosperity as Europeans in a globalised economy .
Besides , the contemporary German professors , August and Werner-Karl Heisenberg , have characterised both classical and modern Greek as the mother and nurturer of human civilisation .
I believe that revival of the teaching of Latin and classical Greek in middle education will also provide a cultural shield for the younger generations against the onslaught of the generally levelling effect of the American cultural message , so that only its positive elements are preserved .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur .
The European Year of Languages is important and worthwhile .
All the languages of Europe are equally valuable and worthy of respect in terms of culture .
It could be said that the people who speak the same language share the same mentality .
The mother tongue is not merely a tool of communication , it is in fact more than anything else , it is thought itself .
Language is the most peaceful way of communicating .
Independence is language and language is independence .
The Kurds are a nation with no land or borders of their own , kept together only by language .
Language is a powerful force .
It is the most important bond for a nation .
Large countries , and many smaller ones too , often tyrannise others through language .
It is a means of occupation .
The legislation regarding language in my country is among the most liberal in the world .
We have seen how two different foreign languages have twice been proclaimed the official language ; only at the beginning of last century did our language , Finnish , become the official one .
That is why we have guaranteed the important status of minority languages .
The multilingual nature of the European Union is thus a source of wealth .
At the same time it is also the right of each citizen in each Member State .
The multilingual nature of Europe must be preserved after enlargement too ; there are no obstacles to this .
It is wrong to think that a multilingual environment is costly and ineffective .
Translation is not costly ; it is the most effective practical instrument of peace .
Mr President , in addition to congratulating the rapporteur , I would like to highlight in this debate that the idea for this celebration originates from the Council of Europe , an institution with a particular sensitivity towards the cultural and social aspects of the old continent , which , with its initiative of increasing the knowledge and use of more languages by Europeans , hopes to promote understanding and tolerance and bring citizens closer together .
When we speak of European languages , let us not forget that this does not only mean the official languages of the Member States .
In Europe , many other languages are spoken , some of them thousands of years old such as Euskera in the Basque Country or Gaelic , whose origins have been lost in the mists of time , and others such as Catalan , Galician and Alsatian , which is spoken right here in Strasbourg .
This initiative should also benefit all these other regional and minority languages , and the bodies created by the Member States to organise participation in the European Year of Languages must also include representatives of these other languages , which are also European , and which are the essence and lifeblood of the wealth of our unity in diversity .
Furthermore , the learning of languages leads to an awareness of our cultural diversity and contributes to the eradication of xenophobia , racism and intolerance , which forms part of our Community objectives .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and , at the same time , the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , for having permitted so many amendments , many of them open to broadening the scope of the Year and extending it to rural areas and the least favoured areas .
However , I would also like to express certain concerns with regard to the economic restrictions .
I would recommend that many projects be allowed since it is clear that cultural projects attract a lot of investment from Autonomous Regions and private initiatives which we cannot afford to lose .
I would also ask , in this era when emotions often take precedence over good sense , that we do not support projects which are aimed at exclusion and the use of language to support positions which often seek to cause divisions between people , when the objective of this programme is to unite people .
I would also like to see the European Union begin to take great care of languages which have no country , maternal languages which often have no school and no teachers ; languages which are spoken throughout Europe , which no state accepts and which will never become official .
I am referring , for example , to Ladino and Yiddish .
These languages furthermore do not have any media of their own .
Of the 150 languages which are spoken in Europe , we should make a list of those which are only transmitted from mothers to their children , which are only spoken in a domestic setting and which , currently , with the invasion of the media and with the official use of languages in schools , will have very few years to live .
I would like this European Year of Languages to be opened up to them as well and that a space be made for them so that they may be considered in any other future programmes which may take place .
Mr President , I should like to address my remarks on languages to my fellow Members , of course , but also to our interpreters , who enable this Parliament to function , to the rapporteur , of course , not for his work as rapporteur but because he is also a poet in this Parliament and , moreover , as I have discovered , one who speaks my mother tongue perfectly .
What better rapporteur could there be ?
When one is a new Member of the European Parliament , as I am , one finds oneself dealing with all sorts of things : chocolate , end-of-life vehicles , the qualified majority , dried beans , Spanish lentils , anything and everything .
Then , suddenly , one finds that one is going to have to deal with something that gives Europe its historic and cultural depth , namely its languages .
And when one looks back at the great periods in history , and I am thinking here of the Renaissance , that great age of trade and commerce , what remains of that era today are the cultural achievements , the artefacts of our heritage , and thus will it ever be .
In terms of languages , Europe has known times when a single language predominated : Latin , and also French .
Now it tends to be English .
So what are we to tell our fellow citizens for this year 2001 .
Let me just briefly mention a few points .
Firstly , that European unity may not mean linguistic unity .
Next , that every language is deserving of respect and deserves to be promoted and defended .
This is applicable to any amount of things : monuments , objects , you name it .
Why should it not be the case for mankind &apos; s best and most lasting achievement , i.e. his method of communicating with his neighbour ?
And then , all languages are learnt within the family first of all .
This is why we call them &quot; mother tongues &quot; , and no State , whatever it may be , may have the direct , indirect , explicit or implicit goal of destroying one of its mother tongues , or of allowing it to disappear .
Furthermore , finally , without linguistic diversity , there is no Europe , because this is also one of the few , and perhaps the only , parliament in the world which operates in eleven languages , to the extent that occasionally we speak in this House for the purpose of being interpreted and not to be heard in the original .
It is up to us to construct this dialectic of European unity and its linguistic diversity .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to be able to be here this evening to talk to you and particularly to have been able to hear your views .
Firstly , because the subject of languages is very close to my heart .
As somebody from Luxembourg , I come from a part of Europe where trilingualism is actively practised .
It is to some extent a laboratory which could serve as a basis for others who would like to do what we all wish to do during this European Year of Languages , which is to promote the study of one &apos; s mother tongue and of two additional languages .
On the other hand , we are at a crucial stage , as there is the prospect of achieving agreement at first reading between the Parliament and the Council .
An agreement at first reading is essential as we are working to a very tight schedule .
2001 is no longer far off and preparations for implementing the programme are becoming urgent .
What are the aims we wish to achieve by organising the European Year of Languages ?
First of all , it is important to make Europeans aware of linguistic diversity and of the wealth that this diversity represents .
We know full well that cultural diversity is perhaps Europe &apos; s greatest asset and we must support this cultural diversity , which is based on linguistic diversity .
The various languages of the European Union will never be replaced by a single language , I am quite sure of that .
And even if one particular language of communication spreads further and further , this does not in any way detract from the need to learn languages to be able to function in the European Union .
You have all said so and I fully support you in this .
This leads me to the second great aim of the European Year of Languages : we must encourage the public to learn languages and to do so throughout their lives , starting at a very early age , in nursery school .
Indeed , language learning is important both for personal development and for intercultural understanding , as some of you have pointed out .
It is one of the best weapons for combating xenophobia .
It is also , as some of you have said , essential to finding a job and to everyone &apos; s career prospects .
Furthermore , it will not be possible to anticipate the needs of everyone individually , and so schools must , therefore , in addition to a basic training , prepare people for lifelong learning and in this context , the principle of one &apos; s mother tongue and two other languages should be emphasised .
Learning one language is not an adequate basis for multilingualism .
The European Year of Languages is also a framework , which will enable information to be disseminated on how to learn languages .
Methods have moved on from the traditional ones and much work has been done in this area .
I believe that this Year of Languages should give us ideas of best practice and how we can move from quite theoretical language learning to learning a language for practical purposes .
The European Year of Languages will also complement existing initiatives .
It is designed for the general public and constitutes a huge information campaign .
In order for it to succeed , however , on the one hand it must create an image , develop logos , slogans and information material .
On the other hand , it is envisaged that projects presented by regional and local authorities or organisations will be cofinanced , and I would like to say categorically to those of you who come from border areas that learning one &apos; s neighbour &apos; s language must be one of the major key points emphasised during this Year of Languages .
The year will be organised in close cooperation with the Council of Europe , which is extremely significant .
The Council of Europe has considerable experience in the field of language teaching and we are therefore fortunate to be able to join forces with them .
Many fruitful meetings have already taken place and the ongoing exchange of information between our respective departments is vital to the implementation of this Year of Languages .
I would now like to discuss tonight &apos; s debate .
First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , for his excellent work and also to express my delight at the constructive approach and the useful cooperation built up between the rapporteurs and the Members of this Parliament , between Members and my departments and also between the two institutions and the Council .
I hope with all my heart that this will enable us to successfully see this initiative through and to reach agreement at first reading so that we can start the European Year of Languages .
There were a great many amendments which have , in the meantime , been merged into a smaller number .
It is important to emphasise the fact that the amendments voted for by the European Parliament must be acceptable to the Council if agreement is to be reached at first reading .
I have noted the desire of some Members to include regional and minority languages , and you know how strongly I personally feel about these languages .
You also know , however , how sensitive this issue is for certain Member States .
I think that the definition of target languages as stated in article 1 , Amendment No 15 , provides sufficient scope , whilst enabling everyone to agree on it .
And I am relying a great deal , believe me , on the debates that will take place during 2001 , the European Year of Languages , because these debates will enable us to overcome the problems and fears which still exist with regard to minority languages .
I also hope that at the end of this Year of Languages , their will be no more resistance to languages , because , as has been very clearly stated , there are no small languages , there are only mother tongues , which are all great languages .
I am therefore relying on the debates to help me prepare future activities in this area , and I would also draw your attention to the additional recitals which address this concern : Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 4.The recitals also enable us to take account of other specific concerns , as many of you have pointed out , such as classical languages and cultures , which will not be forgotten during the European Year of Languages .
I shall not dwell on the amendments on which we agree .
The Commission could therefore accept these suggestions insofar as they cover subjects that can be addressed .
On the other hand , the Council is not prepared to accept a long list of studies which could not all be carried out under the European Year of Languages .
In particular , as the Commissioner responsible for the Socrates programme , which specifically covers Comenius , Lingua and Eurydice , as well as Leonardo and Culture 2000 , I would like to stress the fact that this programme provides an appropriate framework to undertake the following studies , which will enable us to look at best practice in the field of language teaching and learning and at the reasons why language learning so often fails .
The studies on improving the quality of language teaching within the European Union that are provided for in the second part of Amendment No 35 and Amendment No 39 ; those on linguistic contacts based on studies of migrant communities stipulated in Amendment No 37 ; those on the opportunities to speed up access to understanding using methods for simultaneously teaching related languages , laid down in Amendment No 38 .
The promotion of bilingual publishing , mentioned in Amendment No 41 , is covered by the Culture 2000 programme , and I shall see to it that projects undertaken in this area are given the priority that they deserve .
Finally , it is true that enlargement of the European Union and the growth in the number of official languages will have certain implications , as Amendment No 36 suggests .
Nevertheless , this issue is beyond the remit of the European Year of Languages and , furthermore , is a matter for all three political institutions .
I am therefore committing myself to doing everything in my power to encourage discussion on this point in the appropriate setting , whist hoping that I can count on the necessary support of the European Parliament .
Lastly , I would like to say a few words about the amendments presented in plenary.Amendments Nos 43 and 12 have the same content , but the wording of Amendment No 43 is better .
Amendments Nos 44 , 45 and 46 which are technical amendments seeking to adapt the text to comitology , do not , therefore , present any problems .
Nevertheless , we know that the Council will not accept Amendments Nos 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 and 51 , which relate in particular to regional and minority languages , since we have already discussed this in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport.As these amendments would jeopardise the chances of agreement being reached at first reading , I cannot accept them .
To sum up , Mr President , it is important that we quickly reach agreement so that we can launch the European Year of Languages .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Youth
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0100 / 2000 ) by Mrs Gröner , on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the Community action programme for youth &#91; C5-0116 / 2000 - 1998 / 0197 ( COD ) &#93;
Mr President , I am very pleased to add my support and my group &apos; s support to this report .
This report had a long gestation period .
But the fact that we are still here so early in the morning is a tribute to the rapporteur &apos; s work on this programme and , indeed , that of the Commissioner and the Portuguese presidency - which has shown itself to be committed to youth , to the voluntary service and to education in its broadest sense .
The report we have ended up with now is more closely targeted , with an emphasis on social protection and , as the rapporteur has said , a more flexible approach than in earlier reports .
We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance .
We will always ask for more money .
The budget is not enough .
It is perhaps Parliament &apos; s role to ask for more .
But we can be pleased with the outcome .
We can be sure that whatever money we have in this programme will be directed at youth and will , in the long-term , be money well spent .
I agree with the rapporteur that this money and this programme will ensure that the efforts are targeted not just at some small sections of society but , as the Commissioner said in a previous report , at all sections of society .
We must look to those who will benefit most and those who are in greatest need and who might otherwise be socially excluded .
We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well .
We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report .
In seven years &apos; time we will look back at the youth of today who will have benefited from this report and be pleased that this was the beginning of real progress .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Gröner for her splendid work and for the personal , almost passionate commitment she has shown in preparing the present report .
I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for contributing to our at long last achieving a good result .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support those initiatives which give young people in Europe opportunities to acquire knowledge , skills and qualifications which will help form the basis of their future development .
The strength of the programme is , of course , that , by means of cross-national exchanges , it encourages young people to contribute actively to further European integration .
It will also lead to understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity within the European Union .
I also think that the programme will ensure that the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded will continue to be propagated .
Through increased communication between young people in Europe , the programme will indirectly help combat xenophobia and increase respect for human rights .
Finally , the Community &apos; s action programme for youth also gives consideration to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , something which we in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party believe to be of crucial importance to all EU programmes .
I would recommend that we support this programme .
Mr President , I also commend the report and thank Mrs Gröner for the excellent effort she has made .
It is a very good report .
Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored .
Indeed in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport it is the &quot; Cinderella &quot; sector of funding , as with sport .
We hope that imbalance will be redressed .
The insufficient commitment to youth affairs from the Council , when the European Parliament was calling for EUR 980 million , shows , in my view , this grave disparity and the lack of commitment on the part of the Council to a very important sector .
The danger , in this regard , with the changes that are proposed , of combining two programmes - Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service - is that several good parts of both those programmes might be lost .
I hope that does not happen .
We should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future .
The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries .
That is an excellent initiative .
The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe .
The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome .
When more funds are needed , budgets should not be cast in stone but be flexible so that they can be amended in the best interests of the deserving needs of youth .
What more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the European Union .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Before the sitting is closed , I would like to thank the interpreters for their generous cooperation this evening , since we have exceeded the time allotted .
( The sitting was closed at 12.45 a.m. )
Principles for recording taxes and social contributions
The next item is the report ( A5-0073 / 2000 ) by Mr Knörr Borràs , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation clarifying Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2223 / 96 as concerns principles for recording taxes and social contributions ( COM ( 1999 ) 488 - C5 ­ 0220 / 1999 - 1999 / 0200 ( COD ) ) .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing here today a subject of an extremely technical nature , of the type which , at first sight , appears to refer purely to issues involving the adoption and transposal of procedures and terminology within the European Union , which is the political framework to which they are to be adapted , as is the case with certain instruments in the statistical field .
We are all aware , or at least I think we are , that it is important that statistical data is not only reliable , that is , obtained scientifically and rigorously , but also , above all , comparable .
This is particularly true with regard to the shaping of the European single market , a context in which we require statistical data which is comparable and equivalent between the different Member States .
I would even go so far as to say that this is even truer , if that is possible , in view of the enlargement of the European Union , a process in which the availability and comparability of information , particularly statistical and economic information , must be treated as absolutely crucial .
I do not intend to dwell on the qualities of ESA 95 - the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts - nor on the progress which it represented in relation to the previous 1979 system , an issue which I spoke about in the House at the time of my report on the proposed Council Regulation amending the Regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure .
What should really be underlined is that , in my view , we must firmly support a Commission proposal which , essentially with regard to an issue as serious as the budgets of the Member States , is inclined to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than criteria such as the amounts due in the field of taxes and social contributions .
It is common knowledge , or should be common knowledge , that there are occasions when administrations may record , as due , amounts which they will never collect , however many analyses of collectability are made , and this therefore leads to what is tantamount to a concealed falsification of the public deficit .
This is a serious issue which has been debated .
We should remember that in the Parliament of a Member State there was also a great argument between one of the candidates for the presidency and his opponent , and current President , in which the candidate , Mr Borrell , rightly condemned widespread use of the criterion of income which , since it had not been duly corrected , in reality amounted to a concealment of the deficit in the public accounts .
Ending this type of practice requires clear principles , as the Commission proposes , which in addition allow , very correctly in my judgement , for the calculation of income with the option of using amounts collected or the amounts recorded in a tax document .
This course of action by the Commission , which some people attack because in short they believe it does not once and for all end the practices of concealing deficit , in no way intends to distort the assessment of the amounts in the national accounts but , on the contrary , to arrive at the same figure in two different ways .
One , in my view the more correct way , or at least the more academic way , is the criterion of income , with the corresponding provision concerning collectability , set out in paragraph ( a ) of Article 3 proposed by the Commission , and the other , set out in paragraph ( b ) of Article 3 , is the criterion of cash receipts adjusted to take account of the time difference between the activity and the cash tax receipt at the end of the financial year .
Both calculation procedures should inevitably lead us to the same figure , which will be the outcome of the tax in that financial year .
I would also add that there is no other accounting method which would correctly record revenue in a budget .
On the other hand , it is obvious that the option to use either of the two methods offers the advantage of a speedier adaptation on the part of those who choose one or other of the systems .
Therefore , I consider that the Commission proposal regarding the treatment of taxes and social contributions in the accounts is both the most correct one and , from every point of view , is effective in view of the possibility that it can be applied immediately .
Nevertheless , we believe that , in order to encourage Member States to gather statistical data , even aggregated data , concerning taxes on products , Article 3 of the Commission proposal should deal with this issue by establishing a similar mechanism for recording and adjusting such taxation .
I therefore take a favourable view of the proposal and I congratulate the Commission .
I would like to repeat that the proposal rightly stresses that we should give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the taxes and social contributions due in the Member States , and allows these two methods of calculation , which make it possible for the systems used by the Member States to be adapted .
A study of the Commission proposal shows that the treatment of taxes and social contributions should indeed follow the two proposed methods .
Finally , I would also like to stress that , consistent with our opinion that the Commission proposal is more an amendment than a clarification and that , moreover , it affects basic concepts , instead of using the procedures under Article 2 ( 2 ) of Council Regulation 2236 / 96 of 25 June 1996 , for the adoption of changes to the methodology intended to clarify and improve the content of ESA 95 , use should instead be made of the introduction procedure set out in Annex A of that regulation .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to ask you , and also the Commission , for your help .
I would be grateful if you could please keep strictly to your speaking time , as our timetable is very tight .
Although Commissioners can , of course , talk for as long as they wish , I would ask them to help me in this regard as well , so that we can finish on time .
Mr President , a Europe that is functioning properly needs transparent and comparable statistical material on its Member States , not least with regard to recording taxes and social contributions .
We have rightly reached agreements in this respect in the European system of national and regional accounts , ESA 95 .
On closer examination , it now appears that the information recorded on taxes and social contributions is not as precise as was hoped because it does not always correspond to the amounts actually collected or collectable for a particular assessment year .
The aim of the proposal under discussion is to refine the recording procedure by applying a correction factor both to cash data and data evidenced by assessments and assessment registers .
The PPE-DE Group agrees with the Commission proposal in this regard .
Two questions still remain , however .
In view of the fact that the proposal effectively contains an amendment to the ESA 95 Regulation and that is implicitly acknowledged by the fact that we are applying the codecision procedure , it does seem logical to grant the Member States a transitional period .
The Member States also need time to adjust to new rules .
We have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and would ask our colleagues in the House and the Commission as well to support this amendment .
A second question to the Commission concerns the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs regarding VAT as a basis for calculating the third source of own resources .
I should have liked to hear the Commissioner confirm whether the Commission is indeed drawing up a proposal to amend Article 8 of the ESA 95 Regulation to the effect that all the Member States will , in the future , have an adequate legal basis to use ESA 95 for the calculation of the third source of own resources , that is to say , VAT .
I should like a reply from the Commissioner and also , of course , a response from the Commissioner to our amendment .
Mr President , the Commission &apos; s initiative on presenting this regulation intended to unify the principles for recording taxes and social contributions is very appropriate .
In order for the accounting methods of the different Member States to be homogenous , as the rapporteur has pointed out , they must use the same criteria .
It is true that , in accounting terms , both the cash receipt criterion and the income criterion can be allowed , but it is also true that the former allows for less juggling of the figures intended to distort the true accounts situation of a country .
In short , the cash receipt criterion makes it more difficult to indulge in that accounting trickery which used to be known euphemistically as &apos; creative accounting &apos; .
It is true that the use of those systems has allowed , for example , certain countries to fulfil the Maastricht criteria , but it is also true that their abuse can distort the picture of a country &apos; s true accounts .
As you know , accounts which do not offer a true picture can be called anything but accounts .
The income criterion , if it is not corrected , for example , by means of the obligation to make provision for non-payment , is an inadequate criterion .
The rapporteur mentioned a debate which occurred in Spain which , in short , resulted from the government claiming ESP 750 000 million in 1997 as social security income , which was theoretically owed but which was clearly never going to be collected .
Thanks to this manipulation of the accounts , to this &apos; creative accounting &apos; , the deficit criteria for joining the first phase of economic and monetary union were complied with .
Obviously , this juggling of accounts will not be possible if the Commission &apos; s proposal is approved .
It is perhaps for this reason that the Spanish Members from the PPE Group have presented certain amendments and have tried to delay the approval of this report .
It is not a question of revising now what was done in the past .
Ladies and gentlemen , what is done is done .
It is a question of demanding , from now on , greater rigour ; it is a question of demanding that accounting figures reflect the true picture of a country &apos; s accounts .
We therefore approve of the Commission &apos; s proposal but we do not approve the PPE &apos; s proposal , which is intended to delay the entry into force of this regulation , or the amendments of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which , since it considers that the regulation amounts to an amendment rather than a mere clarification , in reality delays its entry into force .
Ladies and gentlemen , if rigour in accounting is demanded , it should be so from the outset .
Mr President , firstly I wish to thank Mrs Thyssen for her gesture and for her defence of the amendment we are presenting .
I also wish to thank and highlight the patriotism of Mr Berenguer and Mr Knörr .
This patriotism is consistent because ESA 95 was adopted by the Socialist government , to whose party the former belongs .
Having said this and leaving aside accusations which are truly libellous at the moment , I would like to defend the idea of an extended transition period of two years .
Anybody who knows anything about accounting and who looks at this text with open eyes will know that this implies a profound change in the basic concepts and the data on the resources of the institutional sectors which affect financial companies , non-financial sectors , public administrations and private individuals .
This change is a complicated change .
As any expert knows , the estimations in accordance with ESA 95 require breakdowns which affect no less than 60 accounting categories .
Secondly , this profound and complex change must be done in a gradual way .
As Mrs Thyssen has pointed out , changing and adapting the accounting rules requires a certain amount of time .
At the end of the day this would lead to a fair change because a sudden change would prejudice those States which have adopted the criterion of income , in other words , those which have , to a greater extent , complied with the regulation which entered into force in 1999 .
We are being asked to change a regulation which entered into force a few months ago .
The PPE-DE &apos; s amendment asks for the change to be introduced gradually .
Mr President , I think we would all agree that , if we are to run the Community properly , we need a high-quality statistical base within the Community and the applicant countries .
There has been a broad welcome in the House for this proposal and the apparent ability to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the more notional contributions which may be due .
This is certainly a step forward .
It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit .
So far as the transition period is concerned , many of us will have sympathy with the need for some form of transition because , clearly , if you amend the regulations in such a way that you move from a system which is being used over a long period of time to a completely new system some time will be required .
However , I hope that the countries of the Union will not use this as an excuse , if it is passed , but seek to implement the new system as rapidly as they can - in other words , two years should be regarded as an exception and as a maximum rather than as the normal ration for the job .
On the treatment of taxes and social contributions , I agree with the rapporteur that this is a relevant way of doing the calculations and that we should take a favourable view of the criteria which the Commission intends to set because of the way in which priority is given .
Overall , this is a useful step forward .
I welcome the commitment of the Commission .
I hope that we can work together and see this translated into Community law with suitable adjustments as soon as possible .
Mr President , this debate confirms the Commission &apos; s opinion that we need to provide for the most comparable and transparent statistics possible , since they are essential for the definition of certain basic lines for our actions , and particularly that we need finance to be clarified with regard to its legal formula .
By proposing these amendments , the Commission intended for the recording of taxes and social contributions within the ESA to be carried out according to equivalent methods and , therefore , that there be no differences in approach between the different national public administrations .
This proposal is basically of a technical nature and is intended to fill the current legislative vacuum which allows for differing interpretations depending on the position adopted by each Member State .
The Commission is very happy that our proposal has received broad support and is happy with the report adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which I will comment on shortly .
However , I firstly wish to thank especially the rapporteur , Mr Knörr Borràs , for his work , which , on this complex and technical issue , has offered us great support .
The rapporteur stresses in his report that the objective of the proposal is to arrive at the same figure , regardless of the statistical sources used , and in reality this is our objective .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has approved eight amendments and the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 and 8 without any difficulty .
There is a ninth amendment , presented later , which I will also comment on .
The Commission would prefer not to maintain Amendments Nos 4 , 5 and 6 .
The aim of these amendments differs from that of the regulation .
I understand that , insofar as certain elements of the regulation are amended , we could also discuss the model for calculation of VAT used to determine own resources , but we are talking about a radically different problem .
In response to the concerns of the PPE , I would say that , when asking for the withdrawal of these amendments , logically the Commission must commit itself to presenting a proposal at some point to introduce that amendment , which is absolutely coherent , providing for more correct figures , which we hope will be used in the future to calculate the basis of the contribution to own resources .
We hope that this approach will lead to a resolution of the problem raised .
With regard to Amendment No 9 , the issue has been studied by the directorate-general of ECOFIN and by Eurostat and , having analysed the problem in detail , I can tell you , Mr García-Margallo , that , in principle , exceptions , in statistical terms , must only be allowed where a Member State is not technically capable of providing data .
This has been the case , for example , with the exceptions allowed for certain Member States within the ESA 95 regulations .
We are therefore talking about a technical problem , of not having the capacity to provide data .
In the case in question , there are no technical difficulties to justify that exception , and the regulation has been substantially amended throughout its negotiation to give it more flexibility , in such a way that , in our opinion , all the difficulties raised by the different Member States can be resolved within the margins of flexibility which the regulation allows .
This is the reason why the Commission does not consider Amendment No 9 to be acceptable .
If everything that has been said here can facilitate a convergence of the positions of both Parliament and the Commission , and if Mr Knörr Borràs and the PPE can withdraw the amendments I have mentioned , we believe that this would allow us to make progress with the adoption of the text which will , without doubt , be positive in terms of clarifying future accounts .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
COM in bananas
The next item is the report by Mr Dary ( A5-0093 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the Proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 404 / 93 on the common organisation of the market in bananas ( COM ( 1999 ) 582 - C5 ­ 0277 / 1999 - 1999 / 0235 ( CNS ) ) .
, rapporteur . ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if the Commission &apos; s proposed reform of the COM in bananas , seeking to replace the current system by &apos; tariff only &apos; , were implemented as it stands , it would lead to the disappearance of ACP producers in the short term and Community producers in the medium term .
At the Seattle Summit and then at the Davos Summit , the people of Europe have been able to observe the inability of the WTO to reconcile financial priorities with their own priorities , which are living conditions , working conditions and the quality of the goods they consume.They would not appreciate it if their representatives not only called those values into question today , but actually went further and reneged , in passing , on the Union &apos; s commitment to its ACP partners .
The banana issue is a perfect example of the difficulties the Union is experiencing in establishing the European model the institutions evoke so often .
In that connection the 1993 COM complied with four essential objectives : ensuring the free movement of bananas in the single market while maintaining reasonable prices for consumers , respecting the Union &apos; s commitment to the ACP countries , maintaining Community preference for Union producers like Martinique , Guadeloupe , the Canaries , Madeira and Crete and , finally , respecting GATT obligations .
Under constant attack since its adoption , this regulation eventually led to several WTO rulings against us , the latest in April 1999 .
Always quick on the draw , the United States immediately drew up retaliatory trade measures against Union countries .
To comply with the WTO , the Commission is proposing to go over to a &apos; tariff only &apos; formula , that is , eliminating quotas and introducing a flat rate tariff at an unknown level .
As we know , this system has already been attacked by the majority of operators and producers from all geographic areas .
We are right to question the grounds for an approach which involves changing the rules of the game in midstream , forcing producers to rethink their production plans and marketing forecasts.That has led us to identify reforms complying with the rules of international trade , but not just dictated by it .
The stakes are high .
Since 1993 , the position of the Community producers has been constantly deteriorating .
The same applies to many ACP countries , traditional suppliers .
It is impossible for these producers to maintain fair competition with the great producers and operators in the international network .
We should also remember that over 60 % of the bananas consumed in the Union come from non-ACP third countries .
It is not a question of practising protectionism , but rather of protecting the permanence of a certain method of production .
It is not just the banana we are trying to defend , but a whole production network , which entire regions often depend on to survive .
The margin of manoeuvre is technically narrow , but the choice of a reform model is political .
We need to know what our objectives are .
As I see it , the first priority is to defend the European model at the international level .
That is certainly the position the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously adopted .
Here I would like to thank all my colleagues very warmly for their effective cooperation on this issue , and Mr Westendorp and Mr Fernández Martín for their excellent work too .
As there are no objective reasons for choosing &apos; tariff only &apos; , I propose to retain the first option in the Commission &apos; s proposal , the &apos; transitional &apos; option , and implement it without moving on to &apos; tariff only &apos; , but with a review of the operation of this reformed COM at the end of a ten year period .
The ACP / European Union Partnership Agreement for Development , which replaces the Lomé Convention , provides for a ten-year transition period for the ACP countries , to allow them to conform as closely as they can to WTO rules .
Why should it be any different for bananas ?
I also propose ensuring that the level of quotas will not increase the oversupply already noted , and finally , aware that the third quota will henceforth be open to all , I propose increasing the minimum preferential access rate for ACP products to EUR 300 .
In any case , accompanying measures are essential to ensure the permanence and viability of Community and ACP production .
I have some suggestions : regionalisation of aid , so as to correct the discrepancies observed between the various areas of Community production , establishment of a cyclone compensation measure , a marketing aid to re-establish the balance with the distribution network for dollar bananas , special support measures for organic production and finally , an acceleration of aid provision .
I hope Parliament will follow the line proposed by the Committee on Agriculture , but we also need the understanding of the Council and the Commission .
Of course , this is not a codecision procedure and the Commission , naturally , can reject all our amendments.At a time when a code of good conduct is being set up between Parliament and the Commission , is it judicious to fail to take account of our opinion , and is it reasonable for either the Commission or the Council to neglect the opinion of the people we represent ?
Ladies and gentlemen , as we now have a new report before us and a new team here in the Chamber , I must repeat what I said at the beginning .
I would like to ask for your help in making sure that we finish by 11.30 a.m. , as that is when voting time begins , and we cannot overrun .
So I would be grateful if honourable Members could please keep to their speaking time , and I would also ask the Commission to help out here , although they can of course talk for as long as they wish.That way we can finish on time .
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
( ES ) Mr President , I will be very brief .
I simply want to say that , when the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy received Mr Dary &apos; s report , after a detailed examination of the problems facing the banana industry , we came to the conclusion in our committee that the solution proposed by Mr Dary met the absolutely fundamental conditions for its success .
Firstly , with regard to the international obligations of the European Union , not only towards the ACP countries , but also within the World Trade Organisation .
As you know , the European Union has been condemned for its regime of granting licences for this product , but has maintained the viability of the quota regime proposed by Mr Dary .
In fact , in the Commission &apos; s current negotiations , it appears that the main suppliers would prefer this system .
On the other hand , this is the system which best defends the principle of multifunctionality of agriculture , protects the European Union producers , also protects the developing countries , with whom we have a very special relationship , is sensitive to the protection of fundamental social regulations and the protection of the environment and , lastly , it is the system which best obeys the principle of consumer protection .
For all these reasons , my committee voted in favour of Mr Dary &apos; s draft report .
Mr President , we all want to see the end of the &apos; banana war &apos; , but the immense complexity of the problem deceives no one .
Clearly the banana has become a political issue , with the dispute symbolising a certain conception of world trade , of a Europe which stands by and defends its decisions , its specific political nature and its commitment to the countries of the South .
So on this issue - I know - the Commission &apos; s task is not an easy one .
It is torn between contradictory positions and I understand the difficulties encountered in trying to reconcile the various interests .
But while I share the desire to put an end to a trade war which is poisoning transatlantic relations , this cannot be done at any price , abandoning without compensation the principles of justice and solidarity which guide the action of the European Union .
I , for one - and there are many in this Parliament who feel the same - refuse to see Europe dictated to , even indirectly , by a handful of multinationals with colonialist attitudes and anachronistic social behaviour .
I am sorry , too , that we have not fought for the retention of a specific quota for the ACP countries which alone guaranteed them access to the market .
But the rapporteur &apos; s proposal is satisfactory because it defends the quota system and rejects any automatic move to an exclusively tariff-based regime .
So I thank him and I also thank Mr Fernández Martín for putting the committee &apos; s point of view .
Of course , the ACP countries know they must adapt to world trade .
But let us give them time .
Let us give them enough time , let us give them the means to produce their plants themselves , let us help them build their greenhouses .
Let us encourage organic farming and , in ten years , believe me , the price of African bananas will have fallen to the level of dollar bananas .
They will then become competitive .
If we impose the brutality of an exclusively tariff-based regime too rapidly , bananas are going to taste incredibly bitter to thousands of small African producers .
Mr President , the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on whose behalf I speak , broadly supports the report by Mr Dary and , in general , rejects the Commission &apos; s proposal .
The European Commission has made this proposal supposedly in a spirit of consensus but , frankly , having analysed it at length with the best will in the world , I cannot find a single reason to accept it .
I take comfort in the fact that I am not the only one .
The Commission &apos; s proposal has not been well received by anyone , neither by the Community producers , nor by the ACP countries .
It seems that the Council cannot easily accept it .
Parliament does not like it either .
What is even more serious however is that not even the United States like it .
In this proposal , the Commission not only renounces the defence of Community interests and the interests of the ACP countries but has also , in my opinion , abandoned the minimum degree of neutrality required .
The World Trade Organisation condemned the system of licences in force , which must undoubtedly be modified .
However , the Commission proposes many other things .
It proposes removing any type of quota , and I would like to ask : does it intend in the future to remove the system of aid to producers ?
Has the Commission decided to begin the reform of the common agricultural policy with a reform of the COM in bananas ?
After bananas , will other sectors fall ?
When will we stop protecting Austrian white wines , for example , ?
This clearly remains an open question within the WTO .
However , after the experience of Seattle , I suppose that we should have learnt something from the point of view expressed by the developing countries and , especially , in this case , by the ACP countries , with whom we have commitments and obligations to fulfil .
It is in defence of our obligations and commitments to the ACP countries that the amendments have been presented on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking for our &apos; shadow &apos; rapporteur , Mr Vatanen , and I would like to mention that this is now the fifth time since 1993 and the introduction of the common organisation of the market in bananas that the WTO has considered the Community rules to run counter to international trade regulations .
The banana controversy is a good example of how hard it is to reconcile the interests of the fifteen Member States , the Union , the ACP banana producing countries , European consumers and our trading partners .
I congratulate the Commission for striving to reach a compromise that has regard to the various interest groups .
It is right that the European Union should bear responsibility for seeing that European agricultural producers , including banana producers , earn a sufficient income .
It is not right , however , that the EU and businesses operating within its territory should suffer annual losses of around EUR 400 million because of trade sanctions by the USA and Ecuador , which are a result of our violating the GATT agreement with regard to banana imports .
I would like to express my concern regarding the consequences of Mr Dary &apos; s report for trade policy .
To adopt the report as it is could result in a strong reaction from our trading partners , as it does not even include the possibility of talks to ease access to the market .
There is strong evidence that some Latin American countries will refuse to accept import quotas - at least not without the prospect of better access to EU markets .
For this reason , I would appeal to you to support Mr Chichester &apos; s Amendment No 38 , which states that if the EU does not abolish import quotas it will at least indicate its intention to start official WTO talks on the future distribution of import quotas .
The Union has lost the banana dispute in the WTO four times already and it cannot afford to lose a fifth time , for three reasons.Firstly , the continuation , despite the bans by the WTO , of the EU &apos; s import quota system , which has been found to be discriminatory will lead to the continuance of trade sanctions costing hundreds of millions of euros .
Secondly , if our trading partners receive permission from the WTO to even disregard intellectual property rights , the costs of sanctions will be enormous and could cause long-term damage to EU businesses .
Thirdly , continued breaches of the regulations will hurt our image internationally in matters of trade , which might weaken the case for the European agricultural subsidy model .
This , meanwhile , would have very serious consequences for the whole of European agriculture .
It is high time we showed ourselves to be credible and mature trading partners , as waking up to the realities of the present will accord with our real interests in the long term .
Mr President , the WTO has challenged our Community regulation on bananas several times and each time we have had to redefine the content of this COM and suffer the burden of the fines imposed on us as reparations for damage caused .
It is certainly not easy to find a balanced response which would satisfy our four objectives , which are : supplying consumers at reasonable prices , guaranteeing a future to our Community producers , honouring the Union &apos; s commitments to ACP countries and , finally , at the same time , presenting a case which cannot be attacked by the WTO .
However , in the light of these four concerns , Mr Dary &apos; s proposal is entirely apt , at least that was the feeling of Parliament &apos; s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in unanimously supporting it , a quite exceptional occurrence for such a sensitive subject .
In fact it seems to us that the choice of maintaining the import quotas plus preferential tariffs for the ACP countries for ten years , instead of six , would make it possible to plan for the future of Community and ACP producers , who face a form of competition tantamount to social and environmental dumping .
That we are seeking elimination of any automatic movement to &apos; tariff only &apos; should not be regarded as downright rejection of the measure .
Our intention is to let the situation develop in a way that is economically and socially tolerable for our producers and those of the ACP countries , without damaging the openness of our market .
So the European Union certainly has arguments to present to the WTO , so that this time our approach is recognised as valid .
Of course , the Union may have difficulty determining the quotas in the immediate future , but is that exercise any more difficult than agreeing on adjustments to the customs tariff in the &apos; tariff only &apos; hypothesis ?
For my part I am convinced that the approaching start of the next WTO cycle should mean we can handle this issue positively in a more global context and for that I am counting on the Commission &apos; s determination .
Mr President , it is high time that we resolved this complex and long-standing issue once and for all .
As we all know , there are many competing claims - the claims of ACP banana producers , Community banana producers , EU businesses which have been hit hard by US sanctions , the EU &apos;s role and standing in the WTO and , of course , the rights and interests of European banana consumers .
It will not be possible to satisfy fully all these claims and therefore we have to accept a compromise .
The Commission &apos;s proposal is a compromise between those who demand an immediate move to a tariff only system and those who wish to ignore the WTO rulings and stick with the flawed regime as it is .
That is why the majority of the ELDR Group supports the Commission &apos;s proposal to continue a tariff-rate quota system for a transitional period before moving to a definitive tariff only system .
The Dary report , on the other hand , is premised on the somewhat unrealistic notion that we can ignore rulings from the WTO altogether .
It gives complete priority to the concerns of EU banana producers over the equally legitimate concerns of innocent EU businesses in other sectors suffering from arbitrary US sanctions .
Most strange of all , it risks complicating matters so much further that the Commission , as stated in its proposal of November last year , will be obliged to move directly to a tariff only system .
This would be exactly the opposite of the objectives of those who support this report .
I have also heard that during the vote , which will take place either today or tomorrow , some may advocate referral back to committee .
This would be an undignified act of foot-dragging which would do nothing to address the long-term issues at stake .
We need stability for European and ACP banana producers and EU consumers .
That can be done by rejecting this report and supporting the Commission &apos;s compromise proposal .
Mr President , the common organisation of markets in the banana sector has allowed this sector , which is fundamental to the sometimes fragile economies of the ACP countries and the outermost regions of the European Union , to function .
Less than seven years have passed since the entry into force of the COM on bananas , and the Commission is now proposing a profound modification of its operation .
Furthermore , this has been preceded by disputes within the World Trade Organisation which have generated uncertainties and which have led to difficulties in its correct functioning for Community producers .
For us , a transitional period until 2006 , as proposed by the Commission , is not acceptable , and we should wait at least until 2010 before deciding on possible reforms .
On the other hand , an exclusively tariff-based system is not coherent with the achievement of the objectives of the COM , given that it does not guarantee access to the market or the survival of the Community and ACP producers .
The Commission proposes a quota of 353 000 tonnes and a possible increase in the event of a rise in demand .
Given that the additional tariff quota is not consolidated , its quantity should be capable of being adapted to Community demand , not only in the event of an increase , but also in the event of a decrease .
In any event , we should safeguard the Community preference and prevent any marginalisation of Community production .
Lastly , special attention should be given to the development of the situation of the Community and ACP producers , who are already in a vulnerable position and will be even more so in a context of intense and open competition .
The Commission must carry out a report in advance assessing the consequences of the application of any modification of the system in order to provide the due compensation for its negative effects on prices and incomes as a result of the increase in the global income in question .
I would therefore , Mr President , like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr Dary .
We support his report .
He has been generous with the amendments of the different political groups .
Furthermore , I hope that the Commission will send a clear political signal which will take account of his points of view .
Mr President , the reason we are having to express our opinion on a draft for the banana COM yet again , for the fifth time since 1993 , is the relentless attacks on the Community regime by three large American multinationals.They dominate the world market in bananas and the WTO backed their interests after an appeal was lodged by the United States , which is also imposing very heavy unilateral sanctions on a series of our companies .
But , in fact , almost 60 % of the 4 million tonnes of bananas consumed annually in the European Union are supplied not by Community or ACP producers , but by Latin American third countries where the American companies run vast plantations under production conditions characterised by scant regard for social and environmental concerns .
In traditional ACP countries and Union countries , which already have only a minority share of the European market , bananas are grown in small production units , usually family concerns , and in areas where there is no real possibility of alternative occupation .
So they represent an essential element in the balance of the economic and social fabric of these fragile territories .
After having driven the Ivory Coast to despair to allow five multinationals to lower their production costs to the detriment of cocoa producers , are we now going to grant three American multinationals the exclusive right to the world market for bananas , including the European market , ruining our own producers and those of our ACP partners into the bargain ?
Are we willing to sacrifice production which means life or death to some of our territories for peace at the WTO ?
Unfortunately , that certainly seems to be the route the Commission has chosen , with a short and dangerous transitional system and an exclusively tariff - and uncertain - formula as from 2006 , which would imperil both ACP and European production and put the Community banana market under the control of a few large operators , able to set the profit margins through the commercialisation of dollar bananas .
So the Commission &apos; s proposal is in line with neither the interests of Community and ACP producers , nor the long-term interests of European consumers , because it actually encourages the emergence of a far from competitive market situation .
That is why it has been unanimously rejected not only by our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , but also by the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and the French Parliament .
So I hope our Parliament will follow the Committee on Agriculture , and the European Commission will feel obliged to make new proposals to us , more in accordance with European interests and our cooperation with the ACP countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , seven out of every ten bananas eaten in Europe come from Central America via three multinationals , all with reduced customs duties of EUR 75 per tonne instead of EUR 850 .
We are giving the United States a marvellous present there !
Well , it is not enough !
The United States wants more .
Technically , what does it want ?
It wants the end of import licences , because the B licences give Community bananas and ACP bananas priority sales over dollar bananas .
But , most of all and politically , the United States actually wants the monopoly of the future Eastern European market for their multinationals .
What is Europe doing to face that challenge ?
It is divided and getting bogged down .
We are divided from our German friends .
Indeed , because of the ancient links with the 1945 German diaspora to Latin America , Germany has eaten 100 % dollar bananas since 1960 - though at first they were &apos; armband &apos; bananas .
So much so - it is an open secret - that the three American banana multinationals put their banana butter on SPD and CDU parsnips .
But we are also getting bogged down in technical proposals .
Thus the Commission proposes , before surrendering totally to the United States , a six-year transition period when , in essence , there would be three quotas , including the ACP quota and the dollar quota .
From 2006 , there would no longer be anything but a common customs tariff which would have equal impact on the bananas of the poor of Africa and the bananas of the rich , the multinationals .
We could undoubtedly challenge that , and our excellent rapporteur , Mr Dary , does challenge it .
He proposes that the respite of six years be extended to ten years .
Another four years , Mr American executioner !
And we have tabled amendments too .
We call for regionalisation of aid , because Guadeloupe is further away than the Canaries ; quarterly payment ; cyclone compensation ; the maintenance of the ACP quota ; historical guidelines for imports , instead of first come , first served .
Well , all that is very fine , but the battle is elsewhere .
The battle is for Community preference , first and foremost .
We have to choose : either the Canaries , Madeira and the Antilles - or Chiquita .
It is regional policy that is at stake .
Do we want the outermost regions which depend 100 % on bananas , like the Canaries , to survive , or do we want Dole and Chiquita to accumulate more wealth ?
It is cooperation policy that is at stake .
We have to choose : either Africa and the Lomé Convention , or the WTO .
We have to choose : either Europe &apos; s social policy and human rights , or the multinational slave-drivers who produce with social costs totalling 8 % instead of the 42 % social costs in the Canaries , Madeira or the Antilles .
This is about protection of financial interests , because when OLAF disputes a few centimes of Members &apos; taxi expenses yet is not interested in the annual present of two billion dollars from Chiquita , there is a problem .
The United States was found guilty of two billion dollars &apos; worth of fiscal fraud and it has changed nothing .
When the United States alters its policy , we will discuss the mere 191 million for bananas .
When the United States stops cheating for the benefit of Boeing , Kodak , Cargil and Ford , we will discuss bananas .
In the meantime , we need long , global , political negotiations .
We must talk about Iraq , Echelon , Serbia ; put everything on the table .
Sanction for sanction , retaliation for retaliation .
The banana is a moment of truth.Europe can either surrender or stand up and be counted .
There is a saying that bananas can be eaten from both ends .
Does Europe want to stand up or be eaten from both ends ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we must put an end to the tug of war over a system that complies with the WTO Agreement .
The EU has not exactly covered itself in glory in this almost endless debate .
I respect the Member States &apos; efforts to protect their banana producers against a considerable loss of income , but such considerations cannot justify persistently refusing to comply with agreements under international law .
It should be our objective to create a market organisation consistent with the WTO dispute settlement body &apos; s proposals as soon as possible , chiefly in the interests of companies which , because of the introduction of the COM in bananas , have been forced to accept financial losses which have threatened their very existence.This is also in the interests of those who have been hit by the punitive tariffs imposed by the United States .
No one should underestimate the adverse impact of export restrictions of this kind on the economies of export-oriented countries , and above all on related jobs .
This is an area where some Member States are indulging in protectionism at the expense of others .
We pay subsidies to banana producers , we have to grapple with punitive tariffs , and we have to pay excessive banana prices in our supermarkets .
Those Member States who want to continue with these restrictions have to recognise that they are partly to blame for the current situation , because they have quite simply forgotten to make structural changes in the field of banana production .
The lack of competitiveness of EU banana production cannot be allowed to justify a refusal to accept uniform and non-discriminatory access to the European market .
Mr President , Commissioner , it falls to me to summarise the problems of the COM in bananas in just a few minutes .
That is a considerable challenge and one which makes no sense unless we understand what is really at stake in this issue.It has been a source of conflict for at least a decade , both at the trading level - between the operators - and at the institutional and international level .
The reason for that is simple .
The banana is now one of the great basic human foodstuffs and control of the trade clearly has a geostrategic dimension .
This is a tropical fruit marketed in the Northern hemisphere and its distribution is also a fundamental part of North-South cooperation .
The real question we face is whether or not the European Union can succeed in organising , within its own market , a juxtaposition of flows from the producer regions of Europe , the ACP countries and Latin America .
Today we are debating a proposal from the European Commission which , by providing for an automatic swing towards tariffs , will lead to the ineluctable disappearance of production in European regions , which currently represents 25 % of our market supply .
Such a development would be contrary to the actual purpose of regional policy and the common agricultural policy - the two pillars of the European Union - and we do not want that under any circumstances .
So we must resolutely set the prospect to one side by adopting the Dary report.I congratulate and thank Mr Dary .
For those fundamental reasons , and to protect the interests of consumers on the European market by maintaining a juxtaposition of flows from the Union , the ACP countries and third countries , in the context of genuine and sustained competition based on an adequate number of operators , we ask you to accept all the proposed amendments .
Failure on this sensitive banana issue would be an admission of weakness on the part of the European Union and would represent a very strong and rousing signal , exploited by all opponents of the common agricultural policy to oppose the social , family and multi-functional agricultural model .
It is our duty to preserve everything the Union stands for , especially on the eve of its enlargement .
Mr President , the defenders of the interests of the multinationals in this Parliament have not studied the subject of bananas properly .
They have not studied it properly because they talk about the multiple decisions of the World Trade Organisation and Community violations of international law .
In fact , so far the World Trade Organisation has only declared two extremes incompatible with international commercial law .
The first is the partnership system which linked the importing of non-Community bananas with that of Community bananas .
Community regulations on bananas were modified to comply with that decision .
The second refers to the incompatibility of the exemption in favour of ACP countries within the Community system .
In other respects , the Community system is wholly in accordance with community rules , international law and the rules of the World Trade Organisation .
The problem is that in this case the Commission has been more papist than the Pope and , as Mr Fernández Martín has pointed out , more in favour of free trade than the multinationals themselves .
In other words , at the moment the Commission wants to throw out the banana with everything else - it wants to throw out the baby with the bath water.It does not remain within the strict limits of compliance with our international obligations , but it is taking a political decision which would lead - as Mr Fernández Martín pointed out - to the dismantling of the whole of our Community agricultural policy .
The Dary report , the Westendorp opinion and the Fernández Martín opinion ask the Commission to adapt so as to conform to international law , not to go beyond what it is laid down by the World Trade Organisation , to negotiate and , furthermore , to take account of the fact that , if we give in on this point , we are going to give in on other more important points , such as the maintenance of social and environmental policy requirements on a global level , which is how we stand internationally .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Commission &apos; s proposal on the reform of the banana sector is negative , unacceptable and disastrous for the agricultural sector in the outermost regions and the ACP countries affected by it , which , of course , supply 40 % of the Community market .
I have put this so strongly because , if implemented in the terms which have been laid out , it would lead to the sinking of the economies of thousands of families who live off this very special activity on Community islands such as the Canaries , Madeira , Guadeloupe , Martinique and Crete , not forgetting the producing areas of the ACP countries .
It would therefore lead to social and economic deterioration in regions which are already least favoured and suffering serious and permanent difficulties with their development , with horrendous difficulties in terms of conversion and which are vulnerable to the uniform and homogenous commercial measures which are taken at international level.In my opinion , the European Commission has given in to such measures , incapable of recognising the regional agricultural reality and diversity of the countries of the Union and the need for a genuine policy of solidarity and cooperation with the ACP countries which , until recently , were colonial territories of countries which now form part of the Union .
Therefore , it is a good thing that the Commission is receptive to the report by Mr Dary , who I congratulate , and the amendments tabled , which are intended to achieve the following : correct the imbalances created by globalisation and persuade the Commission to be sensitive to the problems of banana-producing families , not to submit to imports with single customs tariffs and to fight where necessary to maintain , for a reasonable period , its commitment to the citizens and the agricultural organisations involved .
These organisations make up one of the most vulnerable sectors of very special regions of the Union and the ACP countries , with the accompanying social , economic and environmental repercussions .
For many of us , bananas are a national issue , since they are related to our history and our culture .
Mr President , it is important for this House to approve Mr Dary &apos; s report , as the Commission proposal to introduce a tariff only system for banana imports by 2006 is unacceptable .
The flat-rate system that the Commission intends to introduce would cause producers in the outermost regions of the European Union , such as Madeira and the ACP countries , to go bankrupt .
Furthermore , the fiasco at the last World Trade Organisation meeting demonstrated that the WTO is in no position to meet the expectations and demands of the public and of consumers in certain respects , such as product quality , environmental protection , training , social conditions and worker protection , as is evident from the report .
If our policies are to be consistent with our declarations of support for the ACP countries and for the development of the outermost regions of the European Union , we cannot allow agriculture in those regions and its future development - in which the production and export of bananas play a major part - to be squeezed by waves of dollar bananas from the large plantations that banana multinationals own in Latin America.It is against this background that we are supporting most of the amendments in the report , which we also contributed to .
I have in mind in particular the call for a transitional period of not less than 10 years , and which should not imply a move to a tariff only system , as the Commission should assess the impact of the new situation on prices and on the income of banana producers in these regions , so as to ensure that compensatory aid can be adjusted , based on the principle of guaranteed income for producers .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the long run , we cannot swim against the tide of free and fair world trade with the common organisation of the market in bananas .
We ourselves also have to observe the rules that we signed up to when the WTO was founded .
By infringing them and thus triggering sanctions , we are already blocking access to the major US markets - and also increasingly to Latin America &apos; s markets - for whole sectors of our economy .
We will be jointly responsible for large numbers of lay-offs in these sectors if we as the European Union do not change our stance .
That is why we - and I am now speaking on behalf of a significant minority in the PPE Group , which could be a majority the next time - support the Commission &apos; s position .
Following a transitional period , a tariff of EUR 275 per tonne is to be introduced for bananas from third countries , from which bananas from ACP countries would be exempt .
This will protect the essential interests of the ACP producer countries .
However , the Achilles &apos; heel of the Commission &apos; s proposals is the lack of sufficient protection for the interests of banana producers within the European Union , essentially in the peripheral regions and the overseas departments .
They are up in arms about this omission - particularly our French colleagues , and I assume the same applies to Portugal and Spain .
Commissioner Fischler , things are not as the officials in your directorate-general perhaps claim - and I would also like to address this comment to Mr Lamy .
The arrangements for EU banana producers are not as good as they might be .
There is still a need for a political compromise here .
The structural measures envisaged in Title III of the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas need to be considerably strengthened .
If we made just 10-20 % of the total punitive tariffs of EUR 400 million , that is to say EUR 40-80 million , available as agriculture budget appropriations , instead of diverting it for other purposes , we could help our banana producers a great deal .
I call on the Commission to improve the structural measures and so open up the way for a compromise which is fundamentally in accordance with your proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to present my compliments to the rapporteur , Mr Dary , because he has chosen the path of resistance and not renunciation on this complex issue .
Indeed , we find the Commission &apos; s new proposal unacceptable , because it makes unacceptable concessions to the multinationals of Latin America .
Is there anyone in this Parliament unaware of the role played by these multinationals in financing American campaigns ?
Is anyone here unaware that the food safety conditions involved in the production of these bananas are dubious to say the least , and the social conditions are dominated by total disregard for the rights of men , women and children ?
Who can ignore that by bending to the diktat of the United States - under cover of the WTO - the European Union would throw 35 000 of its own nationals in the Canaries and over 30 000 in the French overseas territories out of work ?
Because , ladies and gentlemen , adopting a &apos; tariff only &apos; system after a transitional period of six years , as the Commission proposes , would truly condemn our producers to failure and despair .
That is why , like Mr Dary , I urge the maintenance of quotas and I oppose automatic passage to the tariff system , because , for my part , I refuse to sacrifice our producers in Martinique or Guadeloupe on the altar of a liberalisation beyond all regulation .
Ladies and gentlemen , let us make no mistake , if Europe surrenders on the banana issue today , it will surrender on sugar or rum tomorrow , and the next day it will have to abandon its social model and its development policy .
That is why I want to tell Commissioners Fischler and Lamy , in all seriousness , that , while I understand their legitimate desire to put an end to this dispute , they cannot do it at the expense of the poorest citizens in the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the banana regime of the European Union has already been condemned four times by the World Trade Organisation .
After the United States , Ecuador has also now obtained permission to take retaliatory action for an amount of USD 200 million .
Let us not forget that such punitive measures serve absolutely no purpose at all for our banana producers , but have extremely negative effects on European industry and employment .
Therefore , we cannot afford to be condemned like this again .
We must now come to an arrangement as quickly as possible that complies with the rulings of the WTO , with the promises made to the ACP countries and which is in the interests of our producers and consumers .
That is not easy , but the present system is untenable .
We must , therefore , urgently find and accept a compromise and a more liberal attitude .
In view of the fact that the Commission proposal , in my modest opinion , meets these requirements , I shall support it .
Commissioner , I too remember the European Union introducing a regulation in 1993 on the organisation of the market in bananas , so as to ensure protection of outlets and income for Community producers and to guarantee the exports of the ACP countries to the Community market .
Although they do not produce a single kilo of bananas , the United States has complained to the WTO about the Community banana import regime .
Their one aim was to defend the interests of their great banana companies which are effectively ravaging Latin America and which already dominate over 70 % of the world market .
In 1999 , the WTO panel , orchestrated by the United States , condemned the Community &apos; s import licences system .
The Commission has submitted to that verdict by amending the market conditions to end up with a &apos; tariff only &apos; system in 2006 .
The implementation of this new regulation , which actually goes beyond the WTO ruling , would call into question the distribution of Community and ACP products and would aggravate an already fragile social situation , especially in the French Overseas Territories where the selling price of bananas had already fallen below 3 francs in 1998 and was less than 2 francs in 1999 .
I am glad the Committee on Agriculture has rejected not only the amendments championed by the intermediaries of the American multinationals , but also the Commission &apos; s proposals .
I entirely approve of the Dary report which opposes the automatic move to a &apos; tariff only &apos; system and which defends the principles which presided over the establishment of the common organisation of markets , especially Community preference .
By adopting the Dary report , we will be sending the Council and the Commission the clear signal that our Parliament is determined to defend the interests of Community and ACP producers , to make the WTO recognise that the preferential agreements constitute development aid instruments .
Our vote will also express our rejection of any compromise with the United States that would sacrifice the Community and ACP producers to the profit of the dollar banana .
Mr President , I would like to start by putting some questions to the Commission in the person of Commissioner Fischler .
Why is it that for the banana trade you are advocating pure and simple liberalisation with effect from 2006 , whereas in the case of meat , milk and cereals , which absorb 68 % of EAGGF Guarantee Section resources , you refer to the special characteristics of European agriculture , as the Commission did in Seattle ?
Surely it is unacceptable to be applying two different sets of criteria .
Is the Commission not guilty of double standards here ?
Are bananas the poor relation of agricultural production in the European Union ?
Should the European agricultural model not be used to safeguard banana production in the European Union which will certainly be threatened by the liberalisation being proposed ?
Is there also a plan to liberalise trade in meat , milk and cereals ?
Will the Commission yield to the more radical approach adopted by the United States at a time when the Americans are significantly increasing their support for agriculture ?
Is no attention being paid at all to the fact that bananas are the main agricultural product in four outermost regions which are amongst the 10 most disadvantaged regions in the European Union ?
What is the relevance of Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty , which provides for special treatment for the outermost regions , to the proposal to amend the Regulation on the COM in bananas ?
The multi-functionality of European agriculture , which is a key aspect of the European agricultural model I have already mentioned , needs to be reflected in this reform , since in Madeira , for example ( the region that I represent in this House ) the environmental aspect of agriculture is as important as , or even more important than , its economic aspect .
If banana production were to cease on the island of Madeira , it would represent an enormous environmental catastrophe as well as a serious loss of income for thousands of families .
Furthermore , as we saw in Seattle , the new round of WTO negotiations should be a genuine development round .
For this reason , we can justify giving priority to bananas produced in the European Union and in the ACP countries when we reform the common organisation of the market in bananas and this would be perfectly legitimate .
And it is only by maintaining import quotas that we can achieve this objective , which is perfectly compatible with World Trade Organisation rules .
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , banana production has a special significance in certain less developed countries , signatories to the ACP agreements , island regions such as Crete , and , in particular , outermost regions such as Madeira , the Canary Islands , Martinique and Guadeloupe .
We are not talking about fully developed regions in the centre of Europe which have countless alternatives when faced with changes in market conditions , and where the common agricultural policy invests most of its resources .
For this reason it is not possible for us to accept radical changes in the Community &apos; s trade policy in this field unless we take full account of its regional impact and unless we take the necessary measures in this field in terms of economic and social cohesion .
The Lisbon European Council instructed the Commission to present as quickly as possible practical measures aimed at implementing the Commission &apos; s report on the application of Article 299 ( 2 ) in relation to the outermost regions .
Agriculture is absolutely vital to many of these regions , which are hoping that the Commission will act swiftly and decisively to maintain regional conditions for agricultural development .
Mr President , I believe that these Commission proposals will mean that a number of African , Caribbean and Pacific countries will go out of business .
That will lead to poverty and even more deprivation .
Yes , we have to simplify the system .
It is far too complicated at the moment .
But I believe those countries need time to diversify properly and that is why I would agree with a ten-year transitional period .
Chiquita , Dole and Del Monte , who produce in Latin American countries , have not seen their production levels go down since 1993 .
Their access to the market has not gone down since 1993 .
All they want to do is get more access to the market at the expense of the ACP countries .
Yes , we have to find a solution .
Producers in the UK are being held to ransom by the USA .
We must not let ACP countries go to the wall just to save companies in the EU .
This is not just about bananas ; it is about trade with developing countries overall .
I am quite aware of the inconsistencies in the common organisation of the market in bananas and associated relations with the WTO .
It is difficult to take into account the various requirements and follow a policy which will favour the weakest parties and supply a high-quality product at affordable prices .
Having said that , it is not that I do not think it is possible , as put forward in the Commission proposal , to adopt , as of 2006 , a system which does not impose quota restrictions or tariffs on ACP countries or any other countries .
Postponing this until 2010 would not make much difference , although that would undoubtedly give us more time to find less damaging solutions .
The Commission &apos; s proposal is too similar to the proposal of the Council of Ministers , which does not consider it necessary to allocate part of the budget to a policy of cooperation and protection of the Community &apos; s primary producers in accordance with WTO negotiations .
Rather than adapting to the WTO system , we should endeavour to reform it without giving in to blackmail by US multinationals which make a profit out of exploiting poor countries .
We are all aware of the illiberal acts of these multinationals , which are destroying and corrupting both people and the environment .
The challenge should be to reform the WTO .
The Seattle Summit and the huge public demonstrations made the need plain .
We must reform the WTO , without adversely affecting development and protection policies for poor countries , small producers and craftsmen , but , as per the Dary report on facilitating access to the market for fair-trade organisations in order to invest in environmentally-friendly and socially viable farming practices .
This should be the European Union &apos; s policy .
Mr President , I speak from three perspectives .
That of external trade , where I believe the European Union should uphold progress towards a liberalised world-trade order ; that of industry , European industry , where jobs and industries are at threat from sanctions and they are innocent victims of these sanctions ; and I speak from the perspective of a UK Member of this House who is tired of receiving letters of complaint from companies whose business and whose workers &apos; jobs are at threat from the sanctions through no fault of their own .
I regret various aspects of this Dary report .
I have to say that this timescale of ten years is wholly unrealistic and unreasonable .
I regret the attempt to cling on to quotas and to interfere with trade in that way .
Of course , I also regret proposals for higher rates of tariff , which is another intervention in trade .
The amendment , which has been put down in my name and others , calls for a negotiated settlement of this dispute , which is World Trade Organisation compatible .
That is essential .
We have been down this road several times now and innocent companies and jobs are at risk and being threatened as a result of our failure to come to grips with this situation .
I support the Commissioner &apos;s efforts .
He has a difficult task .
I have to say that I cannot think of anything more reasonable or pragmatic or sensible than the amendment which a number of colleagues have supported me in submitting .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like many of my colleagues in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , I reject the Dary report , but there are also some amendments that seem very reasonable to me .
I have in mind above all Amendments Nos 33 and 34 .
Amendment No 33 calls for financial support for ecologically sound farming in third countries also .
Amendment No 34 calls for fair trade bananas to be supported regardless of their country of origin .
By the way , I think it is a shame that the Greens are not taking part in this debate and also highlighting these aspects .
But through these two amendments this House is clearly indicating that it also wants a global approach , and there are certainly small producers who behave in an exemplary fashion , not only in the traditional ACP countries and in the EU , but also in Latin America and in the non-traditional ACP countries .
In Ecuador , 60 % of banana producers are small producers with less than 20 hectares , and they are suffering from unjustifiable discrimination .
The world is not just black and white , as some people would have us believe , and the Latin American countries have been quite justified in their complaints to the WTO about our common market organisation .
That is why contradictions exist within the Dary report , which , on the one hand , advocates a global approach and support for fair trade bananas throughout the world , but , at the same time , continues to create difficulties of this kind for small producers in Latin America .
I consider fixing the quotas for ten years to be a step in the wrong direction , and I believe that the Commission was already going the right way before this .
To my mind , they could have moved rather more forcefully towards liberalisation , but they were going in the right direction .
I would of course be delighted if Mr Chichester &apos; s amendment , which I have also signed , were to be accepted , but I would like to tell Commissioner Fischler that even if this amendment is not accepted , Amendment No 5 , which was accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , will give him the remit of coming up with a workable compromise acceptable to the WTO .
That is why I believe that the Commission will , in any case , have a mandate to negotiate , including a mandate from Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , at this point in the debate I am not going to enter into a discussion of the Dary report , nor discuss its fundamental points , but I do wish to say that the official position of the PPE Group is in support of the entire Dary report .
That is the official position .
Commissioner , your proposal does not accord with the objectives nor resolve the problems being suffered by the banana industry and politically it is not worthy of our producers.Mr Schwaiger recognised this a moment ago .
Nor does the Commission &apos; s proposal comply with our international commitments .
However , the most serious problem is that , immersed in difficult negotiations with the World Trade Organisation , we are showing publicly , in black and white , where our weak points lie .
Therefore , Commissioner , I ask you to listen to this Parliament - not simply to hear us - and to take note of the directions indicated in the Dary report and the opinions of the two competent committees .
This Parliament is sending you a very clear political message , unanimously from the committee responsible in this area , and I hope that this House will support it by a majority .
Judging by the great political sensitivity which you have always shown , I am sure that you will understand that message .
Furthermore , I am sure that you will find a viable route in the direction indicated .
Therefore , Commissioner , act politically , find a solution and listen to this Parliament .
This is not the time to fail to take account of this House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank you , Mr Dary , for your wide-ranging and appreciative comments on the Commission &apos; s proposal to amend the common organisation of the market in bananas .
By way of introduction , I would like to stress that the Commission takes a positive view of the principles behind many of the amendments , such as the system of historical references for the allocation of quotas .
In fact , these reflect our discussions with the WTO complainants and the ACP producers .
However , the Commission believes that we should not amend our proposal at this delicate stage in the discussions , and I therefore have no alternative but to reject your amendments .
I would like to give my reasons for this rejection area by area .
The first area is the deletion of references to a tariff only system and an automatic move to such a system after a certain transitional period .
I will make no bones about it : the main objective of our proposal is to bring the COM in bananas into line with WTO rules .
The most important part of the proposal is the introduction of the tariff system after a certain transitional period .
On the other hand , this requires agreement with interested parties on the management of tariff quotas during the transitional period .
The Commission firmly believes that your wish to replace the tariff system with a permanent tariff quota system will only lead to renewed attacks in the WTO .
In addition , I would like to point out that the proposal already includes a request to the Council to empower the Commission to enter into negotiations under Article XXVIII of the GATT , so there is no need to refer to this in the regulation .
The second important area is the issue of managing tariff quotas .
The Commission is attempting to negotiate with the principal suppliers about allocating tariff quotas on the basis of historical references .
It would not be advisable to additionally define the individual options until these discussions have been concluded .
Furthermore , with regard to the demand that the tariff quota administration system should not have an adverse effect on operators and producers already present on the market , I must say that if we have to modify the whole COM now , there can be no guarantee that things will stay exactly as they were .
That really would be demanding the impossible .
Our discussions have also covered other alternatives for managing quota C. However , the Commission believes that it would not be appropriate at present to modify its proposal for auctions in relation to quota C , because auctions of this kind are , in any case , a reliable method of allocating licences .
The third area , which relates to quotas , is the extension of the period for maintaining the quota system to at least 10 years .
The Commission considers that extending the period in this way would reduce the credibility of the central theme of our proposal , which is that the COM in bananas should be brought into line with the WTO rules as soon as possible .
As we explained in the explanatory memorandum , the quickest way to do this is through the tariff system .
The Commission has proposed the transitional period because it gives time for producers within the Community and in the ACP countries to prepare for the new system .
Furthermore , if we moved automatically to a tariff only system , there would be no point in having an interim review or an appraisal at the end of the transitional period .
With regard to the tariff preference for ACP countries , the Commission believes that EUR 275 per tonne is sufficient to secure access to the Community market for these countries .
A higher preference would also lead to renewed attacks in the WTO .
If the higher preference limited Latin American countries &apos; access under quota C , this could be interpreted as if we wanted in practice to introduce a special ACP quota .
I shall now turn to the special support measures for our own producers in the European Union .
As I have already said , the principle aim of the Commission &apos; s proposal is to bring the COM into line with the WTO &apos; s final ruling .
The final ruling does not affect our intra-Community support system .
Furthermore , I would like to point out that this is a deficiency payment system , which means that it has a built-in guarantee.If prices fall , subsidies automatically increase .
My last point is about measures giving equal access to organic and fair trade bananas .
There are already horizontal measures in place guaranteeing equal access for organic bananas from third countries and organic bananas from the Community .
In addition , the European Union can grant subsidies for the production of organic bananas under the agri-environmental measures envisaged in the development plan for rural areas .
Measures to support sales of organic bananas can be financed under national and regional programmes .
Fair trade bananas would also come under the horizontal measures for fair trade , which , I hope , will soon be adopted on the basis of a Commission communication to this effect .
As you know , this communication is not just about fair trade bananas , but about fair trade in general .
In addition to the possibilities I have just mentioned , it is also possible to provide support for developing production of organic bananas and also of fair trade bananas in the ACP countries under the Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas .
The Commission is grateful for the wide-ranging discussions that have taken place here today .
Even if it feels unable to accept Parliament &apos; s amendments because of the current international situation , I must say that the whole dossier has been handled very constructively and comprehensively in the various committees that have contributed to the Dary report and in the recent hearing held by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
I shall suspend the sitting until the President arrives .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m. )
Vote
Madam President , at the appropriate moment , I would ask you , pursuant to Rule 161 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure , to request that the rapporteur and the Chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control explain their position in relation to the coherence between the explanatory statement and the resolution that we are voting on .
Madam President , Mr Barón Crespo , Chairman of the Socialist Group , also directed a comment to me .
Last Monday we did indeed have a wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the admissibility of this question , and on whether , as chair of the committee , I should make use of Rule 161 .
Almost every member of the committee spoke on this .
I myself have several times looked into the connection between the resolution , as it now appears in the compromise , and the explanatory statement , which reflects the rapporteur &apos; s position and is her responsibility .
I established the connection , and I said in the clearest terms that the language in the explanatory statement before us is very harsh .
Nevertheless , I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of words in a censorious way , because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement .
As I see it , there is a factual connection and I therefore decided not to reject this explanatory statement and informed the committee accordingly .
Madam President , I tabled this amendment , along with 37 colleagues from the European People &apos; s Party , because I was appalled at the way the media had exploited the explanatory statement which , as everyone should know but obviously does not , is the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House .
I was struck by the contradiction in tone between the explanatory statement and the content of the resolution.They are radically different .
That is why I tabled this amendment .
Having said that , I think you are right , Madam President , to declare it admissible because the vote this amendment involves is not a vote for or against the explanatory statement , but is simply intended to highlight the distance between that explanatory statement and the resolution .
After the explanations given by both Mrs Stauner and Mrs Theato , who has stated publicly in the clearest possible way that the explanatory statement is only the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House , I consider the amendment no longer necessary , and that is why I am withdrawing it .
Madam President , I would like firstly to point out that the rapporteur has not mentioned what is laid down in Rule 161 ( 1 ) which - and I quote the French version - says explicitly : &quot; ... l &apos; exposé des motifs doit être conforme au texte de la proposition de résolution ... &quot; &#91; the explanatory statement must accord with the text of the motion for a resolution &#93; .
I understand , after the chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control &apos; s explanation of the basis of the question , that her explanations should be recorded in the Minutes , not only for parliamentary purposes , but also for the purposes of any possible use of this explanatory statement .
Therefore , bearing in mind that the rapporteur has not spoken on this fundamental issue , I understand that the amendment still makes sense and the Group of the Party of European Socialists accepts it .
In other words , Mr Barón Crespo , you will take over Amendment No 5 , on behalf of your Group , pursuant to Rule 139 of the Rules of Procedure .
Is that correct ?
Yes , Madam President , and furthermore , I would be grateful if , on such a sensitive issue , the rapporteur could speak on the basis of the question , as she is required to do .
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I shall support Mr Barón Crespo &apos; s proposal .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Barón Crespo , I have not specifically reiterated this point , but I am sure you will realise that when I was drafting both the resolution and the text of the explanatory statement I was very acutely aware that they needed to be in accord with each other , and I have really searched my soul about this over the last few weeks .
I did not think it was necessary to say this again explicitly , but if you wish I will gladly do that .
I like to think that I am sufficiently conscientious and intellectually able for you to assume that I would have considered this long and hard , and that I am happy to take responsibility for this and to face all the consequences that you seem to be threatening me with .
on Amendment No 5
Madam President , just so that things are clear , I withdrew the amendment because I considered it unnecessary , but as it is being voted on I obviously support it and I invite my friends to do the same .
After the vote on Amendment No 5
Madam President , although some people are pleased at the decision that has been taken , this creates a very dangerous precedent .
Whenever , in future , there is an explanatory statement which some in the House do not like we have established that every time we will be able to vote against if we wish to do so .
Madam President , since an explanation of vote has already taken place , I believe that this vote is important because it puts a stop to the temptation to write intolerable political pamphlets in relation to Parliament &apos; s resolutions .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Report ( A5-0089 / 2000 ) by Mr Rühle , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on postponement of the decision concerning discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial management of the sixth , seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1998 financial year ( COM ( 1999 ) 227 - C5 ­ 0003 / 1999 - 1999 / 2004 ( DEC ) ) ; on granting discharge to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions , Dublin , for the 1998 financial year ( C5-0150 / 2000 - 2000 / 2094 ( DEC ) ) ; on granting discharge to the European Centre for Vocational Training , Thessaloniki , for the 1998 financial year ( C5 ­ 0149 / 2000 - 2000 / 2093 ( DEC ) ) ; on granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1998 financial year ;
Section IV - Court Of Justice , Section V - Court Of Auditors , Section VI - Part B - Committee of the Regions ( SEC ( 1999 ) 414 - C5 ­ 0008 / 1999 - 1999 / 2166 ( DEC ) ; on postponement of the decision concerning discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1998 financial year : Section VI - Part A - Economic And Social Committee ( SEC ( 1999 ) 414 - C5 ­ 0008 / 1999 - 1999 / 2166 ( DEC ) )
before the vote
We had a problem when we had to prepare the voting list , which was that we could not find the amendment tabled by the Greens , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party for point 5 .
I do not know whether it is possible to have it read out so that we have the chance to adopt a position on it .
Madam President , there are two amendments tabled to Mr Kuhne &apos;s report which propose to postpone discharge for Parliament .
These amendments make reference to the Secretary-General .
If either of these amendments is adopted , will you , as President of Parliament , assume full political responsibility for their content and take the consequences if the demands set out in them are not met by the deadlines .
Mr van Hulten , as President , I take responsibility for declaring these amendments admissible .
I am not expressing an opinion on their content .
Parliament has not yet voted on them .
The problem facing me is whether they are admissible or not .
I am telling you that I sincerely and honestly believe , after examining the position , that these amendments are admissible .
If they are voted through they will obviously be implemented , like everything else we vote for .
on Amendment No 4
Madam President , we have an amendment before us which allegedly sums up the substance of two observations by the Court of Auditors very concisely .
If you think it is necessary , I can read out the full wording of these observations , although personally I would prefer not to .
I just wish to say that I am opposed to this amendment , because I really do not think it serves any useful purpose for us to include tendentious summaries of official documents in our parliamentary documents , even if said summaries are tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
on Amendment No 1 from the Greens / ALE Group
Madam President , Point 6 , on which we have to vote in this amendment , stipulates a deadline of 15 May .
If we were to accept this , we would be contradicting a paragraph that we agreed earlier .
Earlier on , under Paragraph 10 of the proposal for a decision to be precise , we agreed that we wished to see options for buildings management and a financing plan , taking into account the situation on negotiations , by 1 July .
We have already agreed on this , and this was also unanimously agreed in committee , because we accepted that this was only possible if we took account of the situation on negotiations .
If we were now to set a deadline of 15 May without taking account of the negotiating situation , we would not only be agreeing to something which it was agreed in committee simply cannot be done , we would also be contradicting something that we have already agreed upon .
I therefore appeal to the Greens to withdraw this point , failing which I would recommend that you vote against it , so as to ensure consistency with the rest of the decision .
Madam President , this is a compromise amendment which was negotiated among groups and then , of course , examined by the various groups last night .
Our Group supports this compromise amendment with , however , the exception of one word : &quot; plus &quot; - &quot; plus proportionnelle &quot; .
Presumably the English version is &quot; more proportional &quot; .
We cannot accept that word .
However , under the Rules , it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment .
I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted , it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment , except for the problematic word &quot; more &quot; .
As I know that colleagues in other groups had exactly the same problem with this word , I would suggest to friends and colleagues that it might be appropriate not to accept the compromise amendment but to vote instead in favour of both Amendments Nos 100 and 101 , which are compatible , and that would achieve precisely the result desired by many people .
Thank you , Mr Corbett .
But I have to apply the rules .
A compromise amendment has been put before me .
Mr Brok , could you respond to Mr Corbett &apos; s remarks , and say whether you agree to change the compromise amendment ?
Madam President , we would like to keep the compromise amendment .
I put the question to Parliament .
Are there any objections to our putting this compromise amendment to the vote ?
I thought that was the case .
Madam President , I think it is fair that it be put to the vote .
However , my Group and many others will vote against it in order to support Amendments Nos 100 and 101 , which will achieve almost exactly the same effect with the slight improvements .
Yes , Mr Corbett , but I have to ask Parliament if there are any objections to my putting the compromise amendment to the vote .
Madam President , this amendment has been tabled under the Rules of Procedure and it should be voted on accordingly .
If it is rejected , we can then switch to the rules suggested by Mr Corbett .
That is the simplest approach .
Let us have a vote on the amendment , and if it is rejected , we can proceed as Mr Corbett has suggested .
Excuse me , Mr Brok , Rule 130 of the Rules of Procedure is very clear .
It says that if there are any objections to putting a compromise amendment to the vote , the President of the European Parliament must leave it to the wisdom of the House .
I am only following the Rules , just as I should .
( Parliament decided not to put the compromise amendment to the vote )
on Amendment No 118 from the Greens / ALE Group
Madam President , there seems to be a lack of correspondence between the different linguistic versions of Amendment No 118 .
The French version simply refers to &quot; les autorités compétentes &quot; , whereas the English version refers to &quot; the competent devolved authorities &quot; which , in English , has a more significant meaning .
We established our voting lists in favour of this amendment on the basis of the French version .
However , I understand that the original version is , in fact , the English one , in which case , unless the word &quot; devolved &quot; in the English version can be removed , I will recommend my Group to vote against this amendment .
Madam President , the French text takes precedence .
Right , thank you for making that clear .
on compromise Amendment No 227
Madam President , your services were informed yesterday that we would not sign this compromise amendment .
on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group
Madam President , we wish to request a split vote , first on the term &quot; four-fifths &quot; and then on the rest .
Actually , a split vote on the original text is scheduled , that is , if the amendment is rejected .
Are you withdrawing this amendment , in which case we will hold a split vote on paragraph 29 ?
Is that right , Mr Brok ?
Madam President , if we were to do that here , we would not need to present the oral amendment on Paragraph 29 .
So it would be easier to do that here .
So what you want , if I have understood properly - and I also want to check with the rapporteurs - is for us to vote on paragraph 29 with an oral amendment .
Is that right ?
Madam President , I have the highest regard for Elmar Brok , but in this case he is mistaken .
The only point of the compromise amendment was to add the word &quot; continuing &quot; in English or &quot; anhaltend &quot; in German to &quot; serious &quot; , which is &quot; schwerwiegend &quot; in the German version .
That is the old text .
We have not agreed on the four-fifths majority , so it is just too late for this now .
We cannot split this again now .
If the amendments are withdrawn , I will take the vote on the original text .
Now , on the original text of paragraph 29 , I believe I had a request for an oral amendment from one of our rapporteurs .
So I will give him the floor to present his oral amendment and then we will have a split vote and roll-call vote on paragraph 29 .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , if you would like to present your oral amendment , Parliament will decide .
Madam President , the oral amendment consists of adding the word &apos; continuing &apos; to the second part .
That is clear .
Are there any objections to putting this oral amendment to the vote ?
Madam President , this interesting idea simply takes up in oral form the compromise amendment that has just been rejected .
It is not really in order with our normal procedure .
Are there twelve Members against putting this oral amendment to the vote ?
( More than twelve Members rose to oppose the vote on the oral amendment )
Madam President , I would like to say just one thing to the Group of the Party of European Socialists.It has subsequently voted against or withdrawn its name from all the compromise amendments that it had signed , without informing us of this .
I do not think that this is a reasonable way to do business or how we should treat each other !
Madam President , I must refute what Mr Brok said .
A number of compromises were made and we respected those compromises , except in two cases where there are problems , as we sometimes find when we take compromises back to our various groups .
I proposed a solution in both cases .
In this case , we informed your services yesterday that we would not be signing that compromise amendment .
Thus , it should never have been tabled in our name .
It may have been a compromise between the ELDR and the EPP Groups , but it was not a compromise which we signed .
before the final vote
Madam President , I would like to make a political declaration on behalf of my Group in relation to an issue which I believe has left a nasty taste in the mouths of all the groups in this House : the vote on paragraph 3 , on the composition and distribution of seats in the European Parliament .
My Group will vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen report , but I propose that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , in its wisdom , be charged with the task of finding a solution to this issue , because it is enormously sensitive throughout this House .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
President .
I warmly congratulate our two rapporteurs , Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen .
( Loud applause )
Mr President , I would have been tempted to follow the example of Mr Cox and abstain from the vote on Mrs Stauner &apos; s report , but , in all honesty , I have to say that before I left to come to Strasbourg , some pensioners asked me what I was going to do here .
When I told them that my tasks included voting on the postponement of discharge , which we are discussing today , they asked me to remind the President of the House that the pensioners and their party , which I represent , consider that expenditure takes up too great a part of the European Parliament &apos; s budget.They therefore call for expenditure to be halved and the resources freed up in this way used to increase the pension funds of the 15 Member States , which have been in serious difficulties for too long now .
- The Liberal Group today supported the amendment tabled by Jean Louis Bourlanges of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , which called for the resolution to be separate from the explanatory statement .
By way of explanation , consider the following quotes :
&quot; One might conclude that the Commission had decided in some fields to draw a veil over and forget past events .
The Commission has sought to distract the public attention from unresolved internal problems in the present by making glib and bombastic promises for the future . &quot;
&quot; The Commission apparatus which wielded excessive power even under President Santer has now become even more powerful ; moreover it is all too often dominated by coteries &quot; .
By any standards these comments are excessive , unfair and , in the context of the discharge procedure , wholly unsuitable .
On the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today : to vote in favour , to vote against or to abstain .
We chose to abstain and this requires explanation .
To vote in favour of the Stauner report is to vote for postponement of granting discharge which , all things considered , we believe should be granted now .
As we explained in the Budgetary Control Committee , our preference was to vote &quot; yes &quot; to reform but &quot; no &quot; to visiting on this Commission the sins of its predecessors .
In the Liberal Group we have been consistently in favour of many of the elements in the Stauner report such as access to documents - it is a duty of the current Commission to provide access to documents .
But the political question remains - is this the moment and is this the issue for an apparent public stand off between Parliament and the Prodi Commission ?
We think not .
If we do not vote in favour of the report it is because we want to indicate a preference to do business on reform now rather than later because we believe , on the evidence to date , that this Commission is a reformist Commission .
Voting against the report would merely have the effect of sending the report back to the Budgetary Control Committee without a clear expression of what happens next and by what means .
We are against such an approach .
So we have chosen to abstain .
This is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one .
Our Group preference was to have voted to grant discharge while promoting reform which we accept is also the view of the European Commission .
Unfortunately , today &apos;s choice did not allow for such an option and so we have chosen to abstain .
The French Socialist delegation has voted for Mrs Stauner &apos; s report postponing the granting of discharge for the financial year 1998 , because it resulted from a compromise by our political group with the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
This resolution reflected the desire of the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to break the deadlock over Mrs Stauner &apos; s proposed report in the committee , but also in the European Parliament , which was putting our institution &apos; s relations with the Commission onto a defiant footing .
The French Socialist delegation is glad a majority was achieved to pass Amendment No 5 highlighting the slippage between the resolution put to the vote and the explanatory statement .
By that vote , Members have reaffirmed that only the rapporteur is responsible for the explanatory statement .
The proposed report Mrs Stauner submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control caused consternation far beyond the members of the committee itself .
Indeed , the proposed document bore little relation to the discharge procedure , which is about approval of the accounts for the financial year and the propriety of the expenditure .
The resolution put to the vote in Parliament today presents a catalogue of reasonable demands and recommendations to the Commission .
The postponement and the response time given to the Commission allow it to answer the questions from the Committee on Budgetary Control within the set time .
They leave the Committee on Budgetary Control sufficient time to prepare a report which will rule effectively on the implementation of the 1998 budget by the Commission .
- ( IT ) The delegation of the Democratic Left to the European Parliament , of which I am chair , voted against the Stauner report on the 1998 discharge because it does not agree with the basic line taken .
The report does not focus on the Commission &apos; s actions during 1998 , to which the discharge relates , pursuant to Article 205a and Article 206 of the Treaty and Article 89 ( 5 ) of the Financial Regulation , but is lingering over alleged cases of fraud , most of which occurred in the early nineties during the terms of previous Commissions .
The Prodi Commission has undertaken a vast reform , which is necessary in order to modernise the European civil service and to reorganise its structures in preparation for the many challenges which it will have to face over the next few years .
We , too , are convinced that reform of the budgetary control and programme management procedures is essential , for these systems have proved to be inadequate .
Indeed , it is necessary to ensure not only that past cases of fraud cannot be repeated , but also , and above all , that the level of management errors identified by the Court of Auditors in its annual report is greatly reduced .
In any case , it is not by attempting without fresh proof to reopen disciplinary proceedings which have now been concluded that we will achieve a thorough , effective reform of the Commission .
It should be recalled that 80 % of Community funds are managed at national level , and improving the financial management of the European Union budget could not therefore be contemplated without the cooperation of the Member States .
Furthermore , we fear that behind this unjustified vicious attack lies an attempt to use such incidents to undermine and sabotage not just Commission actions but the work of the European institutions in general .
We cannot therefore support the perpetrators of these schemes , and , for this reason , we voted against the report .
Kuhne Report ( A5-0097 / 2000 )
- ( NL ) In view of the inadequate management with regard to the buildings and personnel policy contracted out , as mentioned in the Kuhne report and in the report by the Financial Controller , we are of the opinion that discharge to the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the 1998 budget must be postponed .
The European Parliament must operate the same high standards with regard to its own management as are required of the Commission .
We are convinced that discharge can only be granted to the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the 1998 budget , provided that specific measures are taken to buck this deplorable trend once and for all .
We are very much in favour of a specific action plan through which such mismanagement can be prevented in the future .
Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen Report ( A5-0086 / 2000 )
Mr President , I would like to underline that no one in Parliament will agree with every single item and every single paragraph of this important report .
That is clear .
The overall message that we are giving to the IGC is that this Parliament wants the IGC to be ambitious , to think long term and not short term and to address all the issues that need to be addressed if a Union of nearly 30 Member States is to be able to function effectively .
We have put a large number of suggestions on the table .
Clearly , not all of them will be taken up in the form which this Parliament has advocated .
But we know that .
We think it is right that the IGC should look at these issues , look at them seriously and come up with appropriate solutions that will enable the Union to work .
My Group , as you know and as Barón Crespo has just said , has some reservations on particular points .
They relate , in particular , to the composition of this Parliament , where unfortunately attempts to reach a compromise position fell down at the last minute .
We must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this House .
I am confident that we can do that .
We were very near to a compromise agreement .
We should be able to crack this one .
We are happy to vote for the report , given the circumstances , and with the reservations I have just described .
Mr President , I have voted against this report .
I say this with regret .
I have voted against this report for almost the same reasons that Mr Corbett has voted in favour .
I have the same objectives : an ambitious Intergovernmental Conference which deals with the real issues and looks to the long term .
I believe that this Parliament is sending a confused message to the Intergovernmental Conference through this resolution .
Reading it will not give a true idea of the message that Parliament wanted to send in relation to this Intergovernmental Conference .
Therefore , Mr President , while I am in absolute agreement with many of the things said in the resolution , I disagree with many others and regret , for example , with regard to an issue as important as the Court of Justice , that the resolution essentially fails to provide for the necessary reform of this institution , nor does it provide suitable clear guidelines in this respect .
For all these reasons , I regret , once again , to say that I have voted against .
Mr President , we are opposed to the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen report because it proposes an integrated , centralised , rigid model of Europe , which is the opposite of our Europe and which can only block enlargement .
We find three points in this report particularly harmful .
The first is the federalisation of the institutions , by making qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament the general rule , introducing transnational European elections , and strengthening the powers of the Commission in an attempt to turn it into a European Government .
The necessary but unacknowledged counterpart of all these measures is the marginalisation of the national democracies .
The second is making a constitution out of the Treaties and adding a restrictive European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights , gradually subjecting the peoples to texts which go far beyond them and which will be imposed on them , without any of them , individually , being able to escape that .
Thirdly , the totalitarian drift of so-called European democracy , with the introduction of mechanisms , in particular making the application of Article 7 of the EU Treaty more flexible so that a Member State can be suspended , mechanisms , then , which will give a handful of leaders authority to operate a thought police across the continent , even against peoples expressing themselves democratically , as in Austria .
One of the most controversial points that arose during the debate was the contradiction between the anticipated proliferation of Members of the European Parliament because of enlargement , and the ceiling of 700 Members the Treaty of Amsterdam has imposed on our Parliament .
That limit was chosen to make the European Parliament resemble a national one , but all it does today is set the countries against each other , as none of them will accept a reduction in its quota of Members , and that is understandable .
The Europe of Nations Group proposes putting an end to these conflicts by breaking through the ceiling of 700 Members .
Why not a European Parliament of 1000 Members ?
It could work in variable geometry formations and its originality would have a powerful impact on the imagination .
Mr President , I shall endeavour to explain myself clearly .
I voted against this report and I was not alone in doing so .
We did so with conviction on behalf of the European regionalists of the ALE .
We form part of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , but by taking this position we wanted to express our disillusionment over what is being discussed here today .
This agenda is , of course , too restricted .
Europe is very ambitious when it comes to enlargement , which is a good thing , but it is not ambitious enough to provide a real democratic structure that emanates from the regions and the people .
We regret that all amendments that serve to incorporate this dimension into Europe have been rejected .
We have had to conclude that , contrary to our expectations , the power of the large states will increase and the power of the European Parliament and the possibility of our regions being represented within it , will decrease .
We therefore hope that the IGC will prove successful in getting vigorous reform under way .
We had to vote against because we do not fully identify ourselves with the structure of this democratic Europe .
Mr President , like many others in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , I have voted against this report for many reasons , but above all for three reasons .
First of all , it is not , as many perhaps believe , federalism which is now a salient feature of Parliament &apos; s attitude but , rather , centralism .
It is the big States which are obtaining more power , those and the central institutions .
There is no trace of decentralisation and the redistribution of power and no sign of any substance being given to the subsidiarity principle .
Secondly , no adjustments are being made in anticipation of enlargement , which is perhaps the most serious feature of all .
If a Union of 28 Member States is to be successful , it must obviously have a flexible structure .
There must be clear definitions of powers in regard to what is to be decided centrally , what is to be decided in the Member States and what can be decided at regional level .
There is nothing of this , however .
If such a large Union is to be a real success , a large proportion of the decisions now made centrally must clearly be decentralised to a lower level .
Otherwise , the whole system will implode .
Thirdly , this is no democratic , constitutional process but a case of a power game behind locked doors .
I have therefore voted against .
Mr President , I express my disappointment at my Green colleagues and my own group , because I was left with no opportunity to vote on two key amendments on the common , foreign and security policy .
One was an amendment on the arms industries and arms exports and the other was on nuclear weapons .
It was very important for us to have an opportunity to say whether nuclear weapons play a role of any kind in the future of the common , foreign and security policy .
Unfortunately , my Green colleagues deemed these amendments unnecessary , which raises the question whether the Greens are changing their policy on nuclear weapons and on the arms industries .
I voted against the report itself , because I feel that more centralisation means less safety for smaller Member States , less democracy , less involvement of people at a local and national level .
This is not in the interest of the ordinary people of Europe .
A new constitution for Europe that overrides national constitutions , a legal personality for the European Union and , of course , more militarisation : this is not the kind of Europe I want .
I want a de-militarised Europe , a democratic Europe where the people have the real say , not bureaucrats .
Mr President , I voted for Amendment No 100 to the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen report on the European Parliament &apos; s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference , which , I regret , was not adopted by the House .
It laid down that elections to the European Parliament should be held as soon as possible using the same lists of candidates in all 15 Member States , that is to say genuinely European lists .
I feel that this amendment is based on a point which brings the citizens much closer to Europe and the European Union : the citizens who are called on to vote realise that the candidates are the same throughout the 15 States , and this would show them that Europe does exist and that there is a reason for its existence .
This is why I voted for this amendment .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution although I did not agree with the individual points .
I regret that , at the end of the day , only 238 Members voted for the text , and I would like to ask those responsible for the running of this House to check whether the procedure followed really made sense .
To my mind , the fact that so many amendments were tabled is a sign that there had been a failure to reach sufficient agreement beforehand , and the fact that not even the compromise amendments were adopted is a sign that we were not yet ready to vote on this in plenary .
I would also ask you , Mr President , to raise this vote in the Bureau , and to consider whether we cannot arrange matters differently , so that we avoid a mammoth voting session like this , which has lasted two and a half hours .
And I am sure that in the end there was not a single Member here who could understand what this was all about .
We should make sure we do not have procedures like this in plenary in future !
Mr President , although I am broadly in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos report on the Intergovernmental Conference , I abstained on the final vote .
In fact , in the course of one paragraph - paragraph 32 - the scope of which will certainly have escaped the majority of Members , the door has been opened to calling into question the current status of public services in the context of international trade negotiations , especially WTO negotiations , without the agreement of a Member State.This is proposed on the pretext of amending article 133 of the Treaty and , in fact , making it possible to break the principle of the agreement of all the States in establishing the position of the European Union as regards services , investment and intellectual property rights .
The rejection of Amendment No 57 , which would have removed this ambiguity , therefore leads me to abstain on the text although , I repeat , I support its main thrust as regards the IGC .
And I am quite sure the IGC will not retain the current wording of paragraph 32 .
Mr President , I voted for the Dimitrakopoulos report , although I do have some reservations about it.The Dimitrakopoulos report does not go far enough for me in terms of EU federalisation and integration .
I believe that we should go much further , and move more determinedly , towards federalisation and away from nation states , towards the regions and the peoples of Europe .
I hope , even if the omens for this Intergovernmental Conference are not the best , that there may still be an opening here or there .
I am enough of a realist to know that this is a gradual process .
That is why I voted for this report and I hope that we will take many more such steps in the near future .
Mr President , I abstained in the final vote for several major reasons and also some minor ones .
It was difficult for me to support the resolution because it mixes the worst in with the best .
On the other hand , I did not want to vote against a resolution which probably represents the best the European Parliament can do at the moment .
The obvious conclusion seems to me that Parliament itself still has a long way to go to meet the profound aspirations of the majority of European Union citizens .
Moreover , the rejection of two compromise amendments during the sitting bears witness to the difficulty of finding representative majorities , as does the rejection or acceptance , by the narrowest of margins , of institutional measures of the highest importance .
To take just one example , Parliament was only able to maintain a compromise on the composition of the Commission with difficulty , but truth obliges me to state that the compromise incorporates two contradictory ideas .
We have passed a resolution actually stating that the number of members of the Commission should be limited , as long as it is not .
Is that really a very sensible position for a Parliament to take ?
Ainardi , Bakopoulos , Eriksson , Figueiredo , Frahm , Koulourianos , Meijer , Herman Schmid , Seppänen and Sjöstedt ( GUE / NGL ) , in writing .
We , Members from different parties in the GUE / NGL Group , have not voted in favour of the report concerning the European Parliament proposal for the IGC .
We oppose the development of the European Union towards a state with superior powers to those of the Member States in all aspects of policy , as the report in practice advocates .
Instead of transforming the EU into a state , we are of the opinion that the Union must be democratised .
Democratisation of the European Union must be achieved through a decreasing of the Commission &apos;s power , the introduction of openness and transparency to the legislative practices of the Council , and strengthening of the role at EU level of the national parliaments .
We further protest against the report &apos;s advocacy of the militarisation of the EU .
We insist that the EU remain a civil organisation and that the non-aligned countries &apos; special status be respected .
We are of the opinion that the Intergovernmental Conference must reconsider the construction of the EMU , reassessing the currency union &apos;s lack of democracy and its right-wing policies .
We demand that the stability pact be reconsidered and Article 56 of the Treaty be rewritten in order to bring the ECB under democratic control .
We reiterate our condemnation of the failure to submit the EMU project to referendum in all of the Member States .
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament today voted against the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen on the European Parliament &apos; s proposal for the IGC .
We consider that in insisting on a broad agenda , the European Parliament is not facilitating what should be the main task of the IGC , namely that of resolving the outstanding institutional problems regarding the composition and voting rules of the Council , the Commission , the European Parliament , the Court of Justice and the other institutions , and so making enlargement possible .
The European Parliament ought instead to take up the important task of ensuring that the essential issues which need to be resolved are debated in such a way that Europe &apos; s citizens are involved and can form their own views on the important subjects being debated .
The EU should build on a common political will to achieve the overriding objectives relating to peace , the environment and prosperity in Europe , focusing on the interests of its citizens .
The debate in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , which adopted the draft report with a very small majority , plus the fact that more than 200 amendments have been tabled for consideration in plenary , show that this report cannot contribute to creating a common basis for the IGC .
Despite the fact that we do not consider that the European Parliament should propose all these amendments to the Treaty , we have elected to adopt positions on the individual points , as will be evident from our voting .
However , we would like to draw particular attention to the points which we think the IGC should concentrate on .
As regards the composition of the European Parliament , we have voted for calculation of the number of Members from each Member State according to a sliding scale so that the European Parliament &apos; s composition reflects the size of the individual States , populations as well as the fact that there are benefits to be had from making the European Parliament more representative by enabling the different political viewpoints in the individual countries to be represented there .
As regards the composition of the Commission , it is important that all States have the right to a Commissioner with the same rights and obligations , particularly as in our opinion , the Commission must continue to enjoy the right of initiative .
When it comes to the voting rules in the Council , we consider that a balance must be maintained between the interests of the small and large states.This can be achieved by laying down requirements for a certain number of votes in the Council which must , at the same time , represent a simple majority of the total population of the Union .
We are open to discussing increased use of qualified majority voting , although we do not consider that it should be the rule .
Each particular instance of a transition to qualified majority voting must , however , be analysed and debated thoroughly and a balance struck between what is fundamental as far as the individual Member States are concerned and the need to make cooperation work .
It is especially important that this matter be discussed on an on-going basis with Europe &apos; s citizens .
All Member States must demonstrate the political will to make cooperation work .
It is this will and the desire for common solutions which the EU must also build on in future .
We are not , therefore , worried that , following enlargement , the EU will be paralysed unless a thorough reform of the Treaty is carried out now .
In parallel with the IGC , the Member States are discussing a common European security and defence policy .
These discussions are far from complete , and we do not think that the European Parliament should table amendments to the Treaty before the outcome is known .
We continue to believe that the EU should not be an actual defence alliance .
In this area , the EU must focus in particular on conflict prevention and civil crisis management .
Also in parallel with the IGC , the creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights is being debated .
We would like once again to stress that we want a charter in the form of a political document and that it should not be raised at the IGC with a view to incorporating it into the Treaty .
The commitment of the Portuguese members of the Socialist Group to the European project is a constant point of reference in its work and in its founding principles .
The building of Europe is today , more than ever , essential for peace and progress not only in Europe , but also throughout the world .
The European project is a gradual process , which has been able to adapt to changing realities and to respond to the vicissitudes of history .
We find ourselves today at one of those key moments at which the European Union needs to rethink and adapt its policies and its institutions so that it can respond better to the challenges of enlargement and of the effective and democratic functioning of its institutions .
Advocacy of a progressive political union , pursuing the federalism which was at its origins , strengthening European citizenship and the economic and social cohesion and cultural diversity of its peoples are essential and inseparable aspects of the options before us .
The institutional implications of enlargement cannot be allowed to damage the fundamental balance - which the Treaties successfully express - between the twofold legitimacy of the union of peoples and the union of states which underpins the European project and which has made a decisive contribution to shaping its institutions .
The deepening , at global level , of European integration with a view to political union must satisfactorily preserve this fundamental balance which has ensured the success of the European project , bringing together states with such divergent demographic and geographical characteristics .
Enlargement should not in any way be used as a pretext for making institutional changes which would gratuitously upset the equilibrium carefully created since 1957 , as these institutional changes have no direct logical or political link with enlargement .
It was out of respect for these principles and convictions that we recognised the value of , and voted for , the European Parliament &apos; s proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference ( IGC ) on the revision of these Treaties .
And it is also out of respect for these principles and convictions that we have felt obliged to vote against the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen report , which , in our view , attempts to respond to the challenges of enlargement by means of solutions which would lead to a significant imbalance in the twofold legitimacy of the union of peoples and the unity of states .
Accordingly , with regard to the solution proposed for the composition of the European Parliament , we believe that insufficient attention has been paid to certain aspects which , in our view , are fundamental.These relate to the need to eliminate a quantified minimum number of seats in the European Parliament for each Member State and to introduce a degressive approach which can correct the negative effects of strictly applying the rules of proportionality .
Furthermore , we believe that the references in the report to the composition of the Commission are also not totally clear .
We do not believe that the proposal in the report describes with sufficient clarity and openness the adoption of a criterion putting all Member States on an equal footing , whether the Commission is made up of one Commissioner per Member State or of a college of 20 Commissioners .
The same thing could also be said about the idea of a simple rotation principle and about how this would work , which we believe should be properly spelt out if the scenario of a Commission consisting of only 20 members is adopted .
With regard to qualified majority voting in the Council , we believe that the system proposed is not in fact the most acceptable .
In fact , although we agree with the double majority principle , we believe that the solution to be adopted should involve Council measures requiring two thirds of the votes of the Member States and a simple majority of the Member States with a majority of the population.We believe that this approach will ensure greater cohesion in the decision-making process .
As regards the rotation of the Council Presidency , we are also unable to accept the new system proposed , under which the presidency of the Council in its various formations shall be divided among the Member States so that the same Member State may not hold the Presidency of more than one of these formations at the same time , and shall rotate by periods of at least two years .
We consider that this new rule does not guarantee the necessary balance and equality in the representation of the Member States in the Council .
The issue of electing 10 % of the Members of the European Parliament via European lists is also insufficiently clear .
We believe that the wording used in the report to describe this option is relatively vague and does not as such offer any guarantees that it would be used to create genuine European public opinion of the kind we would like to see .
The European list is a good idea , especially if the only people included in it are individuals who represent a genuine point of reference in the spirit of Europe .
Nevertheless , it is our view that this concept should be considered in greater depth so that the fears that we have legitimately expressed here can be set aside .
We are also unable to accept the rule on qualified majority voting for decisions concerning appointments .
Until now all decisions in the European Union relating to appointments have been taken unanimously , and there has never been a lack of appointments or any kind of crisis .
We believe that the unanimity rule has the virtue of ensuring a greater balance and of avoiding possible conflicts between large and small countries within the European Union .
However , the spirit in which we have voted should not be confused with the motives of those who have a self-seeking and limited vision of national interest .
Unlike certain others , we want a politically strong European Union capable of sharing sovereignty and of making an ever greater contribution to social progress and to the well-being of its citizens .
The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group will continue to work , alongside those political forces which favour the broadening and deepening of our political union , to find better formulas for pursuing this political struggle .
For procedural reasons we have made this statement immediately , but some of the points remain dependent on a more detailed knowledge of the changes that have been made .
We wish to add that , because of the speed with which we proceeded to the vote , it was not always easy to understand what we were voting on , there being a certain degree of confusion , specifically about votes on amendments and paragraphs.The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group therefore reserve the right , after studying the results of the vote , to change the way they have voted .
- ( ES ) The process of enlargement which the European Union has started has brought it to a crossroads and its ability to continue making progress will depend on the direction it takes .
It can therefore be said that the IGC , which is charged with proceeding with the institutional reforms which will make enlargement possible , holds the future of the European Union in its hands , since it has to decide between the minimal reform laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the broad reform which will allow the Union to accept the countries which are preparing for accession and pursue its task in favour of respect for human rights , peace and social justice .
Therefore , given that we are at a crucial moment in the process of European integration , it was appropriate for Parliament to send a message indicating what it understood to be the key points of the reform .
In the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report which we have just approved and which I have voted in favour of , Parliament indicates that we have to make further progress and that , to this end , we have to give the European Union the necessary means to complete the shared project of peace and well-being initiated 50 years ago .
Let us hope that the IGC is aiming sufficiently high for the great challenges facing the Union and that it follows that path which Parliament has set for it .
- ( SV ) Enlargement of the European Union is one of the most important issues for the future of Europe .
The aim of the present Intergovernmental Conference is to prepare the EU for this enlargement.If enlargement is to be implemented successfully , certain institutional changes are required .
The EU must become more efficient and more democratic , and a balance should be maintained between the small and large countries.Moreover , it is important that the Intergovernmental Conference should be concluded before the end of the year so that the process of enlargement which has been embarked upon is not delayed .
The report on the Intergovernmental Conference is the European Parliament &apos; s contribution to that conference .
It discusses both the necessary institutional reforms , about which no conclusions were reached in the Treaty of Amsterdam , and a number of additional questions which must also be dealt with prior to enlargement .
We , the Swedish Members , Mr Pierre Schori , Mr Jan Andersson , Mr Göran Färm and Mrs Ewa Hedkvist Petersen , support the main features of the report , but we would highlight the following points on which , to some extent , we have different opinions , which is why we abstained from voting in the final ballot .
The role of the European Parliament is to represent the people in the Union .
Enlargement means more States &apos; representatives in Parliament .
If an efficient decision-making procedure is to be maintained , there must be a change in the way the seats are distributed .
We advocate a ceiling of 700 Members of the European Parliament .
The number of seats allocated to each country is determined through a system of degressive proportionality on the basis of the country &apos; s population .
Should a system with a single European constituency be introduced , the number of Members should not be increased .
A new weighting of votes in the Council is a prerequisite for successful enlargement of the EU .
It is important that the solution should be a permanent one and not need to be changed in connection with any future enlargement .
It ought to strike a balance between the principles of , on the one hand , &apos; one country , one vote &apos; and , on the other hand , &apos; one citizen , one vote &apos; .
An alternative would be for the weighting of votes in the Council to be calculated on the basis of the root of the population in the individual countries .
We believe that each Member State should have a Member in the Commission .
The Members of the Commission work for the whole Union and are important if a consensus between the Member States is to be achieved .
The Commission should therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the countries in the Union .
In that way , the legitimacy of the Commission would also be strengthened .
The task of protecting the Union &apos; s interests against fraud is to be carried out by the individual Member States &apos; institutions and not by a supranational authority .
It is nonetheless important and desirable that there should be European prosecutors in each Member State and that they should cooperate .
Unanimity in the Council must be required in questions of a constitutional and fundamental nature , as well as in questions affecting general security and defence policy .
Closer cooperation between at least a third of the Member States cannot apply in the case of defence cooperation .
EU cooperation is , in the first place , a civilian European project and ought to be distinguished from military cooperation .
The Member States have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned .
We made great progress in Cologne and Helsinki by preparing ourselves for preventive crisis and conflict management .
It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civilian and military cooperation .
Military aid of a kind which places countries under obligations to each other has no place in the EU &apos; s Treaty .
We are not prepared to dispense with the veto in regard to military cooperation .
- The agenda of the IGC has now been set by the Member States .
We now know its general scope , and it is clear that much of the content of this resolution , regardless of its merit or lack of it , has nothing to do with it .
While Parliament is fully entitled to be aspirational , it is a mistake for us not to have focused our input into what the IGC is actually going to discuss and decide .
I fear that not doing this will damage Parliament &apos;s reputation and standing , and will not be as helpful to the IGC as it could be .
- ( EL ) The citizens of Europe , especially workers , farmers , small and medium-sized enterprises , women , the young , the nouveaux pauvres , all those who suffer under the policies of the EU , are already voicing their anger and disagreement , some more forcefully than others , with the choices being made by the European Union .
Unfortunately , instead of heeding the anxiety and supporting the claims of all these classes of society , the resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference kow-tows to capitalist forces and adopts the decisions made by the monopolies to militarise Europe and intervene in third countries , including militarily , in order to limit further still the national independence and the grass-roots sovereignty of individual countries .
With the Single European Act and the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam , the ÅU is now beginning , under the pressure of enlargement and the new order , to address issues which it was unable to solve at previous intergovernmental conferences .
Despite proclamations to the contrary , what we have before us is an integrated plan of attack by capitalist forces on the democratic , social , collective and personal rights and freedoms which workers have fought hard to acquire within the context of bourgeois democracy .
The European Union is being used by imperialists and multinationals as a battering ram to break the people &apos; s resistance and make them give up their fight for a better tomorrow .
The efforts being made , supposedly in the name of democracy and the &quot; effectiveness of the institutions &quot; , seek mainly to serve the interests of monopolies and they will inevitably be opposed by the workers and people of Europe .
What is the implication behind generalising the majority voting rule by introducing majority voting , in terms of both the number of States and the number of EU citizens , if not complete indifference to , and degradation of , the interests of the &quot; smaller &quot; countries , of the less developed regions , of the weaker classes of society and of the working and grass-roots classes of the EU in general ?
How else are we to interpret the abolition of a country &apos; s right of veto when its vital national interests are at stake ?
What is the point of rotating Commissioners &apos; nationalities and not rotating the presidency of the Union if not to exile a supposedly small country from the centre of power for long periods of time so that it is basically unable to defend its interests and the interests of its people , insofar as they can be defended within the framework of the European Union ?
What is the point of limiting the number of MEPs , despite the increase in the number of Member States of the European Union , if not to silence those voices which criticise capitalist forces and their plans and promote political processes which brook no alternatives and which are confined to vapid changes of power which pose no threat to capitalism ?
Why is the role of national parliaments being eroded by substantially limiting democratic scrutiny ?
Why is the weighting of votes in the Council being changed for the benefit of the large countries , at the expense of smaller countries ?
There is only one conclusion to be drawn from the EP resolution , which the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against , and from the Commission &apos; s recent proposals .
The people of Europe can once again expect no good to come out of this Intergovernmental Conference .
They alone can defend their rights by conducting their own fights , fights which the EU will face in ever more acute form , ever more dynamic form , despite all its efforts to mislead , pull the wool over everyone &apos; s eyes and sugar the pill .
Fights which will lead to coordinated action by the peoples of the EU , to a strong , pan-European , grass-roots front opposed to the EU and its policies and fighting for a different sort of Europe free from rulers , exploitation and war .
The institutional changes envisaged with a view to the enlargement of Europe , whether relating to the composition of the Commission , the weighting of the representation of the Member States or qualified majority voting , do not answer the basic questions we face ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall about the kind of Europe we live in .
European Union policy detaches the most developed regions from any sense of solidarity , accelerating the break up of multinational federations .
It imposes forced privatisation .
Above all , it leads to the policy of a pyromaniac fireman in the Balkans , where all the political , social and environmental consequences still have to be reckoned up .
The stability plan for South-East Europe is a failure : the declarations of loyalty to NATO by the governments of Eastern Europe do not prevent the European Union treating them with contempt and imposing anti-social policies on them .
We must build a Europe capable of enlarging towards the East and the South , to all peoples who democratically express the wish to join .
A genuine public debate , involving all the peoples in drawing up a charter of rights and a common plan for society , would allow us to make progress towards that .
That is why we have voted against this report .
I am sorry I could not vote in favour of the report which contains the European Parliament &apos; s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference , despite the efforts made , especially by the rapporteur , Mr Dimitrakopoulos , to humour small Member States and look after their interests to some extent .
It is inadmissible to seek to cut the smallest national delegation , the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg &apos; s , by a third , without giving any details about reductions to the large delegations .
There are other excesses in this veritable shopping list.I denounced them yesterday in my speech and Parliament has adopted them , in particular as regards the composition of the Commission and the decision-making procedures .
Unanimity cannot be limited to constitutional decisions .
It is completely unrealistic and utopian to think that the members of national parliaments will ratify a treaty which contains such dismantling of their rights , as useless as it is unacceptable , and such a veritable castration of the national parliaments .
The Intergovernmental Conference is not intended to increase the powers of the Union ; the point of the operation is to improve the functioning of a Union enlarged from 15 to 26 or even 30 Member States .
Through these excesses a majority of this Parliament has done Europe a disservice .
, in writing .
( SV ) The Intergovernmental Conference is an historic opportunity for Member States to transform the EU into a democratic , open and efficient organisation , which is why we regret that the governments of the Member States do not have the political will to carry out an in-depth reform of the Union .
We therefore welcome the fact that Parliament wishes to accept the challenge to reform the Union along these lines , but we wish to clarify our position as follows .
A Union of 25 to 30 Member States cannot operate in the same way as a Union of 15 Member States.Instead , we need both an overview of the institutions &apos; working methods and a clearer distribution of labour between the Member States and the EU .
The EU can only function efficiently and democratically if it deals exclusively with cross-border issues and leaves other issues to be resolved mainly at national level .
The difficulty for the Intergovernmental Conference is to find a delicate balance between the desire to create an efficient and democratic Union and the need , at the same time , to reflect the historic balance of power between small and large Member States.In other words , it must be borne in mind that the EU is a Union of both peoples and States .
On this basis , we think it is important for the present Intergovernmental Conference to establish the size of the Commission at one Commissioner per Member State .
With regard to the distribution of power in the Council , the Commission has proposed a system of &apos; double simple majority &apos; voting on certain questions.This means that a majority is required from the Member States , but also that these States should represent a majority of the citizens if a decision is to be implemented .
This is important from a democratic perspective in view of the fact that , in this way , the voting clearly reflects the will of the people .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supports the Commission &apos; s proposal but would emphasise that small countries should not be placed at a disadvantage .
Parliament ought to have 700 seats , distributed among the population on the basis of a degressive proportional scale .
We are well disposed towards trying out a new system involving European lists , which means that elections for a limited number of the 700 seats could take place within the context of a single constituency .
We are aware of the fact that European parties at present have little support among our citizens , but we believe that a supplementary system involving European lists would , in time , lead to an increased European identity .
An EU of approximately 25-30 Member States will lead to more countries wanting to exploit the opportunity that exists for a number of them to go further than others in certain areas of policy ( so-called closer cooperation ) .
We do not think it is appropriate to see this as a permanent solution to the problem which will arise when the EU is enlarged .
The risk entailed in a Europe &apos; à la carte &apos; is that the whole integrity and basic idea of EU cooperation will be lost .
The solidarity between cooperating States would be in danger of becoming fragmented , something which might have very undesirable consequences for the Union as such .
Flexibility of this kind ought to be seen , rather , as a temporary alternative for countries which are not yet ready , or sufficiently well prepared , to enter into deeper cooperation .
The wording in the Treaty of Amsterdam about closer cooperation is therefore an adequate and acceptable solution .
Too many parallel concentric circles create a system which is difficult to supervise .
The Union &apos; s common objectives should be promoted within the context of such cooperation , and no Member State should be excluded from participating .
We welcome the EU &apos; s increased opportunities to pursue a credible foreign and security policy so that the EU can assume increased responsibility when it comes to solving conflicts in the vicinity of the EU .
At the same time , we would emphasise that this development ought not to lead to our having two parallel and competing organisations for resolving conflicts .
It is therefore important to emphasise that the development concerned must take place in the context of close cooperation between NATO and the EU and that representatives of these organisations must sit down together as soon as possible and agree upon a satisfactory distribution of labour .
- While not able to endorse every dot and comma of this report , I support its broad thrust .
If we are to make a success of enlargement a number of key reforms are essential .
A Union unable to make decisions would not serve the purpose of existing or applicant states .
Therefore ,
we must increase the use of qualified majority voting in the Council in order to avoid paralysis in decision taking ,
we must limit the number of Commissioners so that the Union &apos;s executive remains efficient
and we must limit the number of MEPs to 700 to enable Parliament to function effectively .
We must continue to improve the Community &apos;s capacity for external action and further democratise key areas of the Union &apos;s activities .
- ( PT ) Once again , the European Parliament finds itself compelled to adopt a maximalist position on the institutions , a position bereft of any realism .
As usual , it is going all out for an unfettered federalist approach .
This is reflected in the proposal to almost totally eliminate the unanimity rule , to make the codecision process the norm , to institutionalise the European political parties , to create a European electoral club , to integrate the Western European Union , to strengthen Europol , and , to constitutionalise the Treaties in a far-reaching way .
These are ideas from which we have always unequivocally distanced ourselves and will continue to do so .
However , this report also proposes new and unacceptable ideas .
On the pretext that it is necessary to adapt the institutions to the prospect of enlargement , it is now being suggested that there should be a disproportionate strengthening at various levels of the decision-making powers of the large countries and an intolerable reduction of the decision-making powers of the small- and medium-sized countries .
All this suggests and implicitly encourages the creation of political inner cabinets , which are totally unacceptable , and which will make it easier to achieve &apos; enhanced cooperation &apos; .
We are , of course , opposed to such ideas .
At the same time , if the European Parliament approves a report like this , it will appear to be indifferent to situations which are obviously urgent , such as the need to overcome or at least mitigate serious democratic deficits ; the need to modify the monetarist principles - in particular the Stability Pact - which are the root cause of today &apos; s social scourges such as unemployment and unstable employment ; to change the Statute of the European Central Bank so as to ensure greater transparency and appropriate controls and limits on its powers ; and to make the existing principle of economic and social cohesion a reality , which is a vital step in creating a Europe of the future based on solidarity .
The European Parliament could demonstrate its worth by adopting these policies .
But if it opts for the proposals contained in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report , this will suggest that it is becoming increasingly remote from the people it is supposed to represent .
We will therefore be voting against the report .
- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament .
The Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen report covers a wide range of issues which could be considered in the framework of the IGC which is taking place over the remainder of 2000 .
The debate which has begun between Member States is reflected in the points of view expressed within the European Parliament , as is the tension over the scope of the IGC .
The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that it is imperative to conclude the IGC before the end of 2000 in order to leave the EU fully prepared for enlargement .
In order to achieve this , we believe that the scope of the IGC should be restricted to &quot; tidying up &quot; the outstanding points from Amsterdam , plus a small range of other issues .
EPLP Members voted in accordance with this approach , reflecting our concerns over the following areas :
There are doubts over the practicability of a European top-up list from 2009 of 10 % of MEPs to be elected on a single European constituency .
We have concerns over the workings of a European Public Prosecutor &apos;s office whilst being concerned to protect the Union &apos;s interests and resources against fraud throughout Community territory .
Likewise , the legislative measures in criminal matters in respect of fraud damaging the interests of the Union will need to be carefully constructed .
The EPLP believes that unanimity cannot solely be restricted to constitutional items , as issues including tax and social security must be dealt with at national level .
Constitutionalising the Treaties and division into two parts is not acceptable to the EPLP , and the same concerns about unanimity apply here .
The EPLP wishes to see a Charter of Fundamental Rights , but until the content of the Charter is determined , the question of giving it binding legal force should be left open .
Whilst greater coordination is required at European level over our airspace ( i.e. Eurocontrol ) , service provision should remain at national level - the Commission has never suggested a single agency and Eurocontrol already exists to coordinate .
The Commission has not previously called for the establishment of a single European air traffic control agency and the request in this report is superfluous .
- ( SV ) As representatives of the Swedish Christian Democrats , who view enlargement towards the East as being clearly the most important issue for the EU , I wish to make the following remarks before the Heads of Government and State discuss the European Union &apos; s powers and forms of decision making at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
1 ) There ought to be one Commissioner per Member State ( paragraph 10 ) .
This is about the Commission &apos; s legitimacy and future and about its being able to claim popular support .
2 ) There ought to be at least six Members of the European Parliament per Member State and , thereafter , a degressive proportional system as at present ( paragraph 3.2 ) and not , as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes , only four Members per State , followed by a strict proportional system .
This is required if it is to be possible to mirror the political breadth and diversity in each Member State .
3 ) There ought not to be any pan-European lists or single European constituency ( paragraph 4 ) .
So as not to make the distance between electors and elected representatives still greater , the Member States should remain as constituencies .
4 ) 700 should not be set as the upper ceiling for the number of Members of the European Parliament ( paragraph 3 ) .Instead , a certain flexibility should be possible , depending upon the number of Member States in the EU .
5 ) No EU financing of parties which operate at European level should be introduced , nor should any democratically dangerous and arbitrary suspension procedure ( paragraph 6 ) .
6 ) Decisions by qualified majority voting in the Council should not be taken on the basis of a simple majority from the Member States.Instead , it ought to be a two-thirds majority ( paragraph 8 ) , and this in order to win legitimacy .
7 ) A decision as serious as that of suspending a Member State from the EU should require the unanimous agreement of the other Member States and not , as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , the agreement of four-fifths of the Member States ( paragraph 29 ) .
8 ) Social protection should not be regarded as an issue of Community interest ( paragraph 42 ) .In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , this ought instead to remain an issue to be legislated on at national level .
9 ) The financing of the EU should not be completely independent of contributions by the Member States ( paragraph 44.4 ) .
10 ) Respect for neutral States &apos; solutions in the field of defence policy and for their right to make their own decisions should be clearly upheld within the framework of the CFSP ( paragraph 34 ) .
11 ) To make it easier for citizens of the Member States to know which institutions are responsible for what , the principle of subsidiarity ( to which there are unfortunately no references at all in this report ) should be integrated into the Treaty in such a way that the EU &apos; s powers are concentrated upon clearly defined , cross-border core issues .
The national parliaments and local authorities should play an important role by ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is respected and by monitoring governments &apos; action in the Council .
- ( SV ) When the European Parliament today stated its position on the Intergovernmental Conference , I advocated solutions which also provide for the interests of the small Member States .
The trend within Parliament towards less understanding of smaller countries &apos; needs will increase the antagonism between Parliament and the Council of Ministers .
I am concerned that there is no desire to find a balanced solution regarding the weighting of votes within the Council of Ministers and regarding the number of Commissioners who should provide for the interests of both large and small Member States .
Through my Group , I have tabled an amendment aimed at guaranteeing that all of a particular country &apos; s nationalities and regions are represented in Parliament .
I also supported the proposal which emphasised the right of regional ministers to participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers on matters which fall within the scope of their autonomy .
However , I would express my satisfaction at the fact that so much attention has been devoted to the way in which the EC Court of Justice operates .
The Intergovernmental Conference must now give consideration to Parliament &apos; s constructive proposals .
I am extremely surprised at the proposals which would give Members of the European Parliament the right to participate in the appointment of the judges .
Finland supports the proposal that the Commission might be given a mandate to conduct trade negotiations in regard to services and immaterial rights following decisions in the Council with a qualified majority .
When the Council in this way reaches a decision about a negotiation mandate , Parliament &apos; s consent ought to be requested .
Otherwise , there will be a loss of democratic and parliamentary control over the trade negotiations .
Since I do not consider the report to be in earnest with regard to the demands for decision making in the Council , to the way in which judges are to be appointed and to the number of Members of Parliament , I voted against the report in the final vote ( 238 votes in favour , 147 votes against and 73 abstentions ) .
Because the report is far-reaching in its scope and because there is considerable disagreement about it , Parliament &apos; s point of view will be of little significance .
That concludes the vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 2.02 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
I would just like to ask whether Mr Berlusconi &apos; s name was included by mistake in the attendance register in the Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting .
I do not remember Mr Berlusconi being present .
Mr Frassoni , the department responsible will , of course , check up on this in the simplest way : we will ask Mr Berlusconi or his assistants directly whether he was present yesterday .
Mr President , with reference to Mr Frassoni &apos; s intervention , we sent a letter to President Fontaine this morning .
We , too , would like to know how Mr Berlusconi , who is tied up in an electoral campaign in Italy , came to be included on the attendance list ; we would like to know the identity of the joker who played this trick , which is in appallingly bad taste , or whether there is something going on which has nothing to do with politics .
We therefore asked the President of the Parliament , Mrs Fontaine , to carry out an internal enquiry , which we hope will take place during the mini part-session at the beginning of May .
This is certainly a most regrettable incident , Mr Fiori , and I hope that the internal enquiry will shed some light on the matter .
Topical and Urgent Debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Iraq
Mr President , it is very important to point out that sanctions are themselves a form of warfare .
They are targeted at the most innocent civilians , at the innocent people in societies , especially children , the most vulnerable .
The sanctions on Iraq have become a weapon of mass destruction against the helpless people there .
Over 200 children die there every single day .
This is not acceptable .
We cannot allow this to go on .
Denis Halliday , who resigned his position as Director of the UN Humanitarian Mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions , confirmed the UNICEF statistics that 5 000 to 6 000 children die every month as a direct result of sanctions .
Mary Robinson , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , has been speaking out against sanctions for a long time .
She said you cannot expect her to condemn human rights abuses in other parts of the world and let the United Nations itself be responsible for what is happening in Iraq following the sanctions .
In February Mr Hans von Sponek , the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq , followed in the steps of Mr Halliday when he also resigned in protest at the on-going sanctions and the bombing of the Iraqi people .
Within hours of his resignation , the head of the World Food Programme in Iraq since January 1999 also resigned in protest at the sanctions .
These resignations must cause the world community to reconsider the justification for the continuing sanctions policy and also the bombings .
I would like to point out that 70 Congressmen sent a letter to Bill Clinton in the United States asking him to lift the embargo , asking him to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place in Iraq .
It is not just here in Europe that people are concerned , but right across the world .
If anyone looked at the very good documentary by the world-famous journalist , John Pilger , they would see what is happening there .
Can we allow this to go on without saying something about it ?
It is a blatant violation of international human rights laws .
The sanctions are targeting the most vulnerable in society and making them suffer yet , at the same time , the elite in that society and the people who are part of the Saddam Hussein regime do not suffer from the sanctions .
It is the ordinary people who suffer .
We cannot allow this to go on .
It is not right and the US Congressmen who sent the letter to Bill Clinton are quite right : we have to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place .
We also have to address the bombings that are taking place without any UN mandate .
That is absolutely unacceptable .
A whole family was wiped out by these bombings , as shown in Mr Pilger &apos;s documentary .
This is something we cannot ignore and we must push for an end to this inhumane policy .
Mr President , firstly let me say to my colleague and friend , Ms McKenna , that there is nothing in what she said that I do not agree with .
No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves .
The facts have been presented by respected international bodies such as UNICEF .
We have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity .
There are shortages of essential foodstuffs and agricultural infrastructure resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies .
Iraq , once one of the most economically advanced countries of the region , is being reduced to underdevelopment .
But let there be no illusion as to the role of the Iraqi regime in the suffering of its people .
The consistent refusal by the regime to fully implement United Nations resolutions has led to a situation where the sanctions remain firmly in place almost ten years after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq .
Furthermore , the refusal of the regime for five years to accept the oil-for-food programme has certainly contributed to the humanitarian situation .
We , in Parliament , are well-intentioned towards the people of Iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution .
We must concentrate our efforts on convincing Iraq to implement the United Nations resolutions .
We must make it very clear in this forum that United Nations resolutions are legally binding on all members of the United Nations .
The European Parliament must not be seen to undermine the legitimacy of such resolutions in any way .
Any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the Iraqi regime .
It is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the United Nations lifted .
To date , the regime most regrettably has preferred to allow its people to be threatened by disease and starvation than to respect international law .
Full implementation of Resolution 1284 obliges Iraq , among other things , to cooperate with the Red Cross in overseeing the repatriation of detainees .
Let us recall that last January this House voted unanimously a resolution calling on Iraq , as a minimum , to provide answers to the Red Cross as to the whereabouts of the missing Kuwaitis for which there is documented evidence .
I too have met some of these people .
I have shared their suffering with them .
Let us clearly understand that is a tragedy in itself .
We are caught between a rock and a hard place .
It is heartbreaking to see innocent children being sacrificed by their own leaders for purely personal , political motives .
Mr President , during these last few days , Parliament has been watching an extraordinarily powerful documentary on the effects of the sanctions on Iraq , and I would like to thank Patricia McKenna for this .
Civilians , men , women and children are dying because of the sanctions .
I will not repeat the figures , for we are all aware of them and they have been quoted many times in this Chamber .
But what a contradiction.What a tragedy .
In the name of the protection of human rights , the rich , powerful countries of the West are killing communities and starving them to death .
During the war in Yugoslavia , American aircraft continuously bombarded towns , killing civilians .
It is better to tell the truth and admit that the interests of the United States take precedence over those of communities .
Today , we are going to vote on a motion , a very important motion for a resolution calling for an end to the sanctions , an end to the embargo .
I feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution .
There is no doubt about the fact that it is important for Iraq to change its policy and that the existing arms must be monitored and decommissioned , but , in this regard , there is abundant documented evidence that the nuclear and chemical weapons have already been decommissioned .
And that is essential .
However , I also feel that a clear policy must be developed for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons where they exist in the Middle East .
For example , Israel is full of nuclear weapons and no one is asking Israel to decommission .
Unfortunately , even the resolution called for by Egypt was not supported by the European Parliament in Cairo .
We must do everything possible to free this world from the nuclear threat .
Today , I would also like to pay tribute to Dennis Halliday - mentioned by Ms McKenna as well - who was responsible for the oil-for-food deal .
In a world of hypocrites and careerists , Dennis Halliday had the courage to speak out over the implications of the sanctions on the Iraqi people and to condemn the lies of the United States departments .
Saddam Hussein is certainly responsible and guilty , but we are also incurring a great deal of responsibility and guilt in continuing with a policy which maintains the population of a country in extreme poverty , a population such as the Iraqi people , with a rich history and culture , a population made up of people , women , children , who want to live .
I hope that when the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted , this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world .
This is important for all of us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , here we are debating a tragic issue - a source of shame to all of us - and Mr Ford is not here.Not one of Parliament &apos; s noble spirits is here , and yet the sanctions against Iraq are already ten years old , ten years !
People think the war , the missiles and the gassings are over , but the filthy effects of this war , which was never clean , go on .
There is still bombing in the North and in the South .
Cornfields are being burned in a country which invented agriculture ; date palms are being burned daily .
In the Strasbourg newspaper yesterday , there was an interview with a priest who risked his life just to go to the Babylon area , in Ur .
For people who go there , taking ambulances and medicines , like me and the National Front , Iraq is a vast concentration camp .
18 million women , children , old people , men , a whole Arab people , are being held captive in their own country by the West , with millions of deaths every day , hundreds of children dying , a systematic , scientific , meticulous , planned , cynical , perverse genocide .
It is not just their bodies which are under attack by being deprived of food , milk , meat and fruit.Their minds are under attack as well .
There are no books .
Even pencils are banned , on the pretext that their graphite could be used as coolant in the nuclear power stations .
There are schools but there is no paper .
There are doctors , but there is no medicine .
There are hospitals , but there is nothing inside them .
It is perverse .
They were promised food in exchange for oil .
But they are asked to practically give their oil away and then buy food .
Ladies and gentlemen - especially Members who are not here - by what right is this happening ?
Do not keep silent !
Do not be accomplices !
UN officials are resigning .
We should not have to go there in thirty years time , like the Belgians in Rwanda , and say sorry , or like the Holy Father , who is prostrating himself all over the place .
The honour of Europe depends on our speaking out for these young Arabs , for this great people being consigned to the night .
It is all very well being afraid of imaginary dangers in Vienna , but it is in Baghdad that the violation of human rights is taking place .
Let Washington &apos; s Nebuchadnezzar let these people go , these slaves in their own country .
They must be released from this poverty .
I appeal to your consciences !
Europe is denying itself !
Just as people kept silent about Spain in 1936 , just as people kept silent about the camps , they are keeping silent about Iraq .
There is no time to lose ; this people could cease to exist .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I ask you to act quickly .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Parliament will shortly be voting on a joint resolution and that is certainly not just because we are determined to have a clear conscience and actually condemn the perpetuation of sanctions which have never achieved their goals , as everyone agrees .
It is also because we think there is a real possibility of preventing a new risk of military force being unleashed there , given the experience of our colleague , Mr Buttiglione , who has been to Iraq and has alerted us to the fact that there is currently a significant risk of renewed bombing .
He had the opportunity of meeting representatives of the Iraqi government , from whom he was able to obtain a commitment to respect the United Nations resolutions .
So he undertook to ensure that Parliament would send a strong signal to the Iraqi people , given that its government agrees to implement the United Nations resolutions .
We have committed ourselves to ask for the immediate lifting of sanctions .
That is the purpose of this joint resolution and all the groups have agreed that , to show Parliament &apos; s unanimity on this distressing issue , there should definitely be no amendments .
Mr President , I can only endorse the speeches that have just been made , especially Mr Morillon &apos; s .
We certainly cannot continue to accept this situation .
But we can feel gratified that we are voting in Parliament today on a resolution on the situation in Iraq which has , for the first time - and I hope we will take advantage of this to change our style a bit - won the approval of almost all the political groups .
That unanimity is reassuring , because all the signatories to this resolution are in agreement on the essential point.That has happened because we all now know that the essential point is a certain concept of humanity , relations between peoples , values - in short , civilisation , the heart of Europe &apos; s identity .
Mr President , this resolution clearly calls for respect for the UN resolutions , especially Resolutions 687 , 688 and 1293 , and also Resolution 1284 on which we are seeking clarification .
I would mention , too , that only two members of the Security Council voted for it , against the advice of the three other members who abstained .
Mr President , this does not mean we are releasing the Iraqi regime from its responsibilities and obligations .
It means that , for the first time , the international community is being asked to show consistency with its own principles , because the various UN committees agree that these resolutions have been virtually all applied by the Iraqi regime , except for some minor points of interpretation or detail .
And here I differ slightly from Mr Collins .
The fact is the discrepancies between Iraq and the international community do not justify maintaining the embargo .
Remember , the Iraqi people are innocent .
But it is they and not their rulers , who were never democratically elected , who are now paying the price of these sanctions in human lives .
Mr Hans von Sponek , the former head of the UN Oil for Food Programme , mentioned by Ms McKenna just now , said that , as a human being , with a heart and a soul , he could no longer tolerate what he was seeing in Iraq .
He decided to resign .
The disproportion between the constantly reiterated demands of certain members of the Security Council for the sanctions to be ruthlessly maintained and their consequences for the Iraqi people is - I am weighing my words - truly terrifying !
UNICEF estimates that half a million children have died as a result of nine years of sanctions , to the utter indifference of the civilised world .
It must be remembered that the rules of war involve respect for civilians .
The right of coercion over populations - it must also be remembered - should not lead to the right to starve them .
That is also one of the great principles of Western civilisation !
Mr President , our resolution is very consistent .
It calls for respect for all the UN resolutions first and foremost , clarification of Resolution 1284 and , consequently , the lifting of sanctions and constant vigilance against the Iraqi regime , respect by all for the rules of the UN Charter , including the members of the Security Council who are carrying out military action contrary to international law and , finally , the search for a global political solution .
Mr President , that is the only way dictatorships can really be weakened and concord between all the peoples of the region promoted .
For once , Europe must speak with a European voice !
Mr President , Mr Morillon has already explained my Group &apos; s position , which is in favour of this joint resolution .
For my part , I would refer to the procedure which seems to me in this case to be important .
This is a debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance , which has been devalued insofar as we are not getting a declaration from the Council , as Parliament had requested , on including this point as a Council declaration .
I would like to say that , without presenting any valid argument , this attitude on the part of the Council seems to me to show a lack of respect towards Parliament , especially when Parliament offers the Council the opportunity to make any declaration on any subject , as laid down in Rule 37 .
It is truly contradictory that this Parliament cannot obtain a Council declaration on an issue as sensitive as this .
Therefore , Mr President , I would like to say that my Group intends to ask the Committee on External Affairs , at its next meeting , to present , pursuant to Rule 42 , an oral question to the Council so that the Council will reply .
If this initiative is not successful , my political group will present , pursuant to the same article , an oral question to the Council so that the Council really takes seriously the worries and concerns of this Parliament and really does what is laid down in the Treaties , that is to say , to inform and cooperate with Parliament in all those areas which affect and concern the citizens of the European Union .
Mr Salafranca , you and those who are of the same opinion as yourself could also make the Conference of Presidents aware of your views .
The Conference of Presidents is shortly to meet here in Strasbourg in order to establish the programme for the forthcoming part-sessions , and it could issue a request along the lines that you have suggested .
Mr President , I am as concerned as anybody in this House about the suffering of the people of Iraq as the result of sanctions but also of the actions of their own government .
We should all remember that sanctions are sometimes better than the alternatives that we may have to consider .
If we are to support this resolution then Iraq must most definitely honour its obligations under all the United Nations resolutions .
We , as a Parliament , must stand by our resolution of January this year , calling for the release of all Kuwaitis and other non-Iraqi nationals who are still imprisoned in Iraq .
I had the opportunity to visit Iraq last month .
I met the families of the Kuwaiti prisoners .
I can tell you that fathers do not forget their sons , brothers do not forget their brothers , children do not forget their fathers ; nor should this House .
We should remind Saddam Hussein that he must honour his obligations to the international community and we shall then honour our obligations to Iraq .
Mr President , the Commission shares the concern expressed during this debate .
It regrets Iraq &apos; s decision not to accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284 .
As Mr Collins and Mr Morillon in particular have pointed out , this decision delays the application of the new instrument of control and hence the relaxation of sanctions .
We think the Oil for Food Programme is still the best short-term solution to ease the suffering of the Iraqi population , and the Iraqi government should reverse its policy of non-cooperation and comply with all the United Nations Security Council resolutions , as has been said .
Since the Gulf War , the Community has been the principal source of humanitarian aid to Iraq , with at least EUR 240 million provided to reduce the considerable sufferings of the Iraqi people .
And we could have done even more if the Iraqi government had not imposed restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organisations , hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid in Iraq .
Given the situation we cannot pretend that humanitarian aid can do any more than alleviate some of the effects of this awful economic and human situation in the short term .
The economic situation in Iraq can only improve as economic activity develops after sanctions are lifted.This involves engaging the Iraqi government , perhaps more than we are doing today , in a dialogue on the implementation of the Security Council resolutions .
In this regard , we agree with the draft resolution .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m.
Chechnya
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
( B5-350 / 2000 ) by Mr Markov , Mr Vinci , Mr Papayannakis and Mrs Ainardi , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on Chechnya ;
( B5-0363 / 2000 ) by Mrs Malmström , Mr Haarder , Mr Maaten and Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on Chechnya ;
( B5-0366 / 2000 ) by Mr Oostlander and Mr Posselt , on behalf of the PPE ­ DE Group , on Chechnya ;
( B5-0375 / 2000 ) by Mr Sakellariou and Mrs Krehl , on behalf of the PSE Group , on Chechnya ;
( B5-0387 / 2000 ) by Mrs Schroedter , Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Gahrton , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group , on the armed conflict in the Republic of Chechnya .
Mr President , Parliament has been dealing with the situation in and around Chechnya for some time .
We have followed with concern developments in the fundamentalist Islamic forces &apos; attempts to split Chechnya away from the Russian Federation .
We are categorically opposed to any form of terrorism and we support the fight against terrorism in every country in the world .
I believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle .
However , for several months a war has been raging in Chechnya which none of these arguments can justify .
I spent over six years of my life in Russia and have very close ties with that country .
So I feel it all the more that Russia is totally overreacting in its use of military force in the Chechen conflict .
I find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian army .
It is a matter of deep regret and profound concern to me that militaristic thinking has now again taken hold in Russia .
It has long been recognised that military might never permanently resolves any conflict , and this needs to be remembered now .
It is high time that this war ended and that a political solution to this conflict was found , no matter how difficult and complicated that might be .
Furthermore , an enormous effort is required to restore this devastated region for the people who have lost all their possessions in the war and to make it habitable once again .
In the long term , this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict .
My Group supports this motion for a resolution , and we consider it essential that this Parliament , in conjunction with the members of the Russian Duma , should seek means of restoring peace in Chechnya without delay .
Mr President , ten days ago , the UN &apos; s Commissioner for Human Rights , Mary Robinson , returned home from a visit to Russia where she was to investigate the situation in Chechnya in regard to human rights abuses .
Mary Robinson obtained limited access .
She was not allowed to meet the Russian President and was treated in a most humiliating way .
In her report to the UN &apos; s session on human rights in Geneva , Mrs Robinson reported on individual testimonies concerning very serious crimes which had been committed in Chechnya .
The witnesses she had met had told of murders of civilians , summary trials , executions , rapes , torture and kidnappings .
Domestic affairs can never be pleaded as an excuse for atrocities of this kind .
We have a global responsibility to defend basic rights .
Abuses of these cannot - must not - be seen as internal matters .
The UN &apos; s High Commissioner must continue to be supported in his work .
The European Parliament has , on a number of occasions , expressed concern about the situation in Chechnya .
We support the Council of Europe &apos; s decision of last week to suspend Russia if no appropriate measures are taken .
For a liberal , considerations of trade and short-term benefits cannot come before the defence of human rights .
We would therefore react vigorously to these atrocities , but we also see it as very important to cooperate with democratic forces in Russia and with the new government .
We therefore hope that we can organise a joint delegation from the European Parliament and the Russian Duma to travel to Chechnya and , there on the spot , engage in discussions , conduct investigations and bring about a dialogue .
We presume that Russia will be of assistance and allow the delegation to travel freely .
We also hope that the EU can eventually contribute to a reconstruction programme in the region .
Mr President , what has happened in the war in Chechnya has shocked us all .
A guerrilla war is being fought without the civilian population being spared , in fact , the civilian population is also suffering the dreadful atrocities that can occur in wartime .
The first war in Chechnya may have evoked sympathy from us as a battle for autonomy and independence and setting things right in their own territory , but we now have to say that , although this war really ended quite well for the Chechens , the intervening period was not used to best advantage and Chechnya became a country of complete chaos , where kidnapping was commonplace and where the citizens were no longer safe .
At one stage , Chechen generals even invaded Dagestan , an action which merited absolutely no sympathy whatsoever .
This illustrates that there are various movements within Chechnya .
On the one hand , there are the military who tend to play the Afghan card or count on Iran for support .
The other two groupings seek more of a political solution .
One of them is seeking a solution more in terms of what we in Western Europe would also wish to achieve and the other is again seeking to strengthen relations with Russia .
Mr President , the President of Chechnya has limited control over the troops in his country .
We are pleased to hear that Maskadov does not support the actions of his military .
We are also delighted to hear that the Russians are at long last admitting to the fact that Mr Putin is contacting the Chechen authorities indirectly .
We have also noted hat the Council of Europe has adopted a position in this regard .
We know from the Russian delegation that was here until yesterday that this has hit them exceptionally hard and we spoke about it with them in detail .
We have also heard that there is the possibility of a joint parliamentary delegation undertaking a fact-finding mission on an ad hoc basis under the best possible conditions with a view to looking around the territory of Chechnya wherever it sees fit to do so .
A mission of this kind must take place soon and I believe it is important that in the resolution tabled on the basis of the liberal text , an amendment is included to this effect .
Mr President , we support an exceptionally brief resolution in that regard , perhaps even the briefest ever made in this House , consisting of the first two recitals of the liberal resolution , followed by the recital in which the decisions of the Council of Europe are mentioned .
We shall vote against Article 1 because once again it involves support for this statement and we could substitute a better statement of our own .
We shall willingly support Article 2 of the liberal resolution and then Amendment No 2 as well which refers to the joint parliamentary delegation which may be more useful in the future , because it is the future that we must concern ourselves with here .
The delegation will have to examine what can be done to preserve the defence of human rights in the region , but also examine what we can do in the future to help Chechnya become a democratic constitutional state .
Who knows whether with help from the European Union and Russia , a Stability Pact for the Caucasus region can ever be achieved .
Mr President , for these reasons we support this resolution , which initially was not to our liking , but which , at the moment , provides the best basis for a statement from this House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not want to repeat what the three previous speakers have said , with which I totally concur .
In addition , my colleague , Mr Swoboda , will also say a few words about the reasons behind this war.There is a very broad consensus within this Parliament condemning both the war against civilians in Chechnya and the terrorism which started in Chechnya , and this same consensus applies to the desire to maintain good and special relations with Russia .
On the other hand , we are determined not simply to stand by and watch whilst Russia violates one international convention after another in this war in Chechnya .
We support the proposal from Mr Lukin , the Co-President of the Interparliamentary Delegation of the European Parliament and Russian Duma to send a fact-finding mission to Chechnya to gather information on the ground .
We want to make use of this information at a later stage , that is after the delegation has returned , as the basis for a major debate in this House , involving the Council and the Commission , and leading to the adoption of a really well founded resolution .
For this reason and this reason alone we , the Group of the Party of European Socialists , urge you not to adopt a motion for a resolution today - which would in fact bring the total to seven - and instead wait until we have the information we need for an in-depth debate resulting in a joint resolution .
Mr President , firstly I would like to say that , through political pragmatism and through loyalty to the work that we do with the other groups in this House , we will support a joint resolution which basically supports the decision of the Council of Europe and the sending of a joint delegation from the Duma and the European Parliament .
We must also say that we do not share this kind of silence on the part of the European Parliament which is spreading to all these issues like a low mist which obscures everything .
We have even noted that the Council of Europe itself is showing more courage than this Parliament .
What has happened in Chechnya is shameful , the crushing of a whole people , and it is also shameful that this House has had to listen to &apos; Mr CFSP &apos; talking about issues such as &apos; the proportionate use of force &apos; or recommending that the Russian authorities lessen the intensity of the conflict .
What is a proportionate use of force in a case such as Chechnya ?
What proportion are we talking about ?
This is unacceptable .
What is meant by lessening the intensity of the conflict in Chechnya ?
Perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children ?
Perhaps stopping the bombing of hospitals ?
Please explain this to us .
Of course , we still believe that there is sufficient reason to suspend the partnership and cooperation agreement on the basis of the human rights clause .
I would like to end by saying that I fully agree with what Mr Cohn-Bendit said in this House : in this Europe and this World which we want to build , let us have no more masking of attacks on entire peoples on the grounds of their being internal matters.We have had enough of excuses of this type .
There is no such thing as internal affairs in this world we want to build .
Either we have human rights or we do not have human rights .
Mr President , our Group firmly supports the short resolution tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , which largely goes back to a proposal on our part , because we want to see threefold solidarity : solidarity with the people of Chechnya , which is still imminently threatened with genocide , because that is what all this is about , together with energy interests .
Just now we heard about the issue of maintaining order.The history of the twentieth century is littered with strong men who used secret services and other means to create chaos so that they could then present themselves as a force for law and order .
Let there be no mistake , we should not let Mr Putin get away with that .
We must not allow the people of Chechnya to become victims of a genocide motivated principally by raw materials interests .
Secondly , we want to show our solidarity with our colleagues on the other side of the River Ill , with our colleagues in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , who have taken a courageous step and who we should not lag behind in fighting for human rights .
Thirdly , we would like to demonstrate our solidarity with the Russian people , because the war in Chechnya is threatening to become an instrument of nationalism , which will be used to lever out the rule of law and freedom of the press , which are still very weak in Russia , and to turn the clock back in that country .
Anyone who wishes to defend the Russian people must work to ensure that attempts to remove press freedom , as evidenced by the Babitsky case and by many other cases , do not succeed , and that Russia continues on the path towards greater freedom and towards closer links with the European Union .
That is why we must say a resounding &apos; yes &apos; to steps against these wrongdoings and why we believe that it is important for representatives of this Parliament to visit Chechnya as soon as possible , following the example of the Council of Europe and the UN Commissioner for Human Rights , Mrs Robinson .
This joint delegation needs to set off without delay .
It would be a great step forward if this succeeded .
And , as I have already said , it is vital for us to make it crystal clear that we back human rights for the people of both Chechnya and of Russia .
We wish to help both peoples and both peoples have the right to advance towards freedom and towards taking their proper place in the international community .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , foreign policy needs to be based not only on fundamental moral values and principles , but also on success in achieving its aims and objectives , and this should not be confused with opportunism .
I therefore support everything that has been said here about condemning the barbaric war being waged by Russia , which is a war that recalls the darkest days of the Soviet Union .
What we want to see is a new Russia , not a seamless transition from the Soviet Union , but a new Russia .
To my mind , it very much remains to be seen whether the new President Putin can guarantee this , certainly on the basis of what we have seen so far .
So there is no alternative to condemning this war and saying that although we certainly condemn terrorism we regard Russia &apos; s reaction as being totally disproportionate , inappropriate and unacceptable .
That is what we should condemn .
But we should not fool ourselves into imagining that in this case we simultaneously want to achieve something important for peace in Europe and throughout the world as whole , that is to say a dialogue with Russia and ultimately a partnership with Russia .
Unfortunately , Russia is only accepting this in words , not in deeds .
That is why I think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists .
It is the job of the Council Presidency and the Commission , whilst at the same time defending moral values and condemning this war , to endeavour to ensure that we support those forces which are all too poorly represented in Russia , but who nevertheless wish to pursue a European path , a path towards a European partnership , a partnership with the European Union .
This is the formula we need : condemnation of the war and a visit by the delegation , after which we must take whatever steps are necessary .
And if those steps have to be harsh ones , then we should , in full awareness of the facts , not shrink back from taking them .
Mr President , once again we are discussing the situation in Chechnya .
In the last few days the Commission and the Member States have held several meetings with their Russian counterparts : the ministerial troika with Mr Putin and Mr Ivanov on 7 April in Moscow , and the Cooperation Council with Russia , last Monday in Luxembourg .
During these discussions , we have reiterated our main demands : cease-fire and political dialogue , access for , and presence of , international and humanitarian organisations , and independent inquiries into any human rights violations .
All these demands are also in the European Parliament &apos; s resolution and the recommendation from the Council of Europe &apos; s Parliamentary Assembly .
As the European Parliament has emphasised , the Russian authorities have failed to respond satisfactorily to these requests .
All that can be said is that Mr Ivanov finally accepted the European Union and ECHO embassies at the last Cooperation Council .
Recent discussions in the Council of Europe , the Committee on Human Rights in Geneva and this Parliament reflect growing concern amongst the European public .
For our part , we support the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner , Mary Robinson &apos; s request to Russia to set up a broad independent committee of inquiry into any violations of human rights , based on recognised international criteria .
Last Monday &apos; s General Affairs Council stressed the importance of maintaining an open and frank dialogue , including on this subject , with the Russian authorities .
We think Russia should pursue implementation of the partnership agreement in terms of its elements - I do mean all its elements - and provide more concrete results than we have at this stage .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m.

Jewish prisoners in Iran
Mr President , what is the purpose of this joint resolution ?
Surely it is to establish a proper and public judicial process against the thirteen members of the Jewish community in the Southern Iranian town of Shiraz ?
The European Parliament in no way disputes the right of the Islamic Republic of Iran to react against foreign attempts at espionage and where the burden of proof is decisive , to punish them accordingly .
The point is , however , that the arrest and imprisonment of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz up to now has been a real caricature of a normal judicial process , a process that the constitution of the Islamic Republic itself actually provides for .
What fundamental objections are we actually raising against the judicial action taken by the Iranian authorities ?
To start with , a variety of scarcely plausible accusations have been levelled at the accused .
For example , proselytising against Islam and the joint teaching of boys and girls , a violation of the customary separation of the sexes in education in that country .
The latest accusation was scarcely credible to the orthodox Jewish community in Shiraz .
Finally , the official accusers raised the almost stereotypical subject of spying for &apos; America and the Zionists &apos; , which means the state of Israel .
And so these thirteen Jews are being threatened with the death penalty .
And remember , this has been the case for over a year as they were arrested in March 1999 .
The whole affair in the meantime smacks of the unremitting power struggle between the reformist camp around President Khatami and the conservatives around revolutionary leader Khomenei - by trampling on a defenceless Jewish minority of about 30 000 people .
What position should the European Parliament take in this tough , domestic political struggle with regard to the specific case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz ?
Of course , it goes without saying that we should support those Iranian powers that publicly declare that they are striving for a society based on the rule of law and human rights and who are open to contact with the West .
This fundamental choice involves , at the same time , not giving the hard-liners in the Islamic Republic any excuse to undermine this promising path of reform .
Our amendment in paragraph 5 is based on this very consideration .
Iranian fundamentalists will immediately attack the European request to Teheran to support the complete abolition of the death penalty - note that this is a provision that runs directly counter to Islamic law , the sharia , as a renewed attempt at the pernicious westernisation of their own Islamic Republic !
And , in their view , the abolition of the sharia is equivalent to the abolition of the present Iranian form of government .
In short , this addition does nothing to support the case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz .
The European Parliament must not , therefore , give ammunition for propaganda in this matter of life and death to the ultra-conservatives in Iran , who , in the last few years , have quite simply been pushed onto the defensive by Khatami and his followers .
What we have in mind is a clear legal settlement of this tragedy , ending we hope with the release of all prisoners .
That would really add a happy chapter to the almost 2500 years of history of the Jewish community in the land of the Persians .
God willing , that is what we shall see !
Mr President , the trial of thirteen Iranian Jews accused of espionage has opened today in Teheran .
The trial is taking place behind closed doors .
These people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about .
Their lawyers , some of whom are state appointed , were only allowed to look at the files the day before yesterday .
There is no guarantee of the right to a defence .
I am afraid this may only be a mock trial .
Yet the charge is so serious it could lead to the death penalty .
When the case started , we had the privilege of hearing some leading government dignitaries publicly call for the prisoners to be put to death straight away .
This case , which was built up from nothing - I think we are all convinced of that - has mobilised international public opinion powerfully .
With strong feeling all over the world , including in Strasbourg today , the international pressure has had some impact because the Iranian leaders have softened their position , in particular announcing that most of the accused would no longer be appearing on the charge of espionage , tantamount to execution .
Three have been freed on bail.Finally , the court announced this morning that the trial was being adjourned until 1 May , which is a step forward , at least .
But some of the accused are still facing the death penalty and the others face heavy sentences .
The government &apos; s various changes of attitude illustrate their embarrassment very well .
They were incapable of stating the charges clearly until the very last minute .
It is also clear that the outcome of this trial partly depends on how the Iranian political situation evolves .
In the last parliamentary elections , in February , the reformist tendency defeated the conservatives who include the most extremist elements .
So this trial is starting at a significant moment : on the one hand , Iran is signalling openness and progress , on the other , the conservatives are trying to hang on to power by every means at their disposal .
There is consequently a risk that this case of the thirteen Iranian Jews will be used by one faction against another , in step with domestic conflicts .
Justice has little place in that kind of battle , and human rights even less .
So it is imperative that we react .
The European Union is based on the values laid down in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.As a member of the UN , Iran should be applying them too .
That is why we must demand the release of the prisoners : the thirteen Iranian Jews , but also the other eight Moslem prisoners and the students we know absolutely nothing about .
We must also call on the Union governments to do the same .
We also demand that observers be permitted to attend the trial , because public hearings are fundamental to holding a fair trial .
Finally , we must make it absolutely clear that the development of our relations with Iran will be subject to respect for human rights in that country .
Mr President , Commissioner Lamy , ladies and gentlemen , since 1979 , fifteen Jews have been executed in Iran.The charge was espionage , but their real crime was being Jewish .
Today , a new trial is starting in Shiraz , in the South.Thirteen Jews and eight Moslems have also been detained for a year in Iranian jails , facing death by hanging .
The youngest is only sixteen years old .
Back in September , Parliament resolutely called for respect for the fundamental rights of these prisoners in terms of a fair , just and public trial , with their own lawyers and with international observers present .
When the more moderate elements won the last elections , we thought our call had been heard .
But now there is this parody of a trial , a summary procedure behind closed doors before a revolutionary court presided over by a single judge , and a cleric at that.As for observers , so far Teheran has not granted any visas .
In other words , we are disappointed , disappointed and alarmed .
We are continuing to insist that the international community be able to follow the proceedings from start to finish .
Furthermore , at the request of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , the European Parliament is urgently calling on the Council to send an official delegation to visit the prisoners .
There is no such thing as an internal matter where human rights are involved .
Our feelings are as strong as our concern .
We must make ourselves perfectly clear .
Iran &apos; s possible return to the bosom of the international community has a price today .
We hope the Council and the Commission will rally unequivocally to our position .
We must remain intransigent on this point - human rights are not negotiable .
Mr President , Commissioner , if voices other than ours had not been raised in the last few days , to give the Iranian Government a warning , thirteen Iranians charged with espionage just for being in touch with relatives in other parts of the world would , at this very moment , be facing trial behind closed doors under summary procedure , leaving them no chance of their most basic rights to a defence being guaranteed .
You have just heard confirmation , from Mr Sylla , that this planned mock trial is at least going to be adjourned for a few days .
That means there is the utmost justification for dealing with Parliament &apos; s second joint resolution on this issue under urgent procedure .
It also means there is a chance this resolution - expressing our indignation - might be heard in Iran , where the results of the recent elections have raised the hope of progress there on fundamental human rights.As everyone who has already spoken has said , it is our duty to ensure that those rights are respected .
Mr President , when we learned a few months ago that thirteen Iranian Jews had been imprisoned a year earlier , we were concerned for their fate.At that time , in an effort to reassure us , the Iranian Government told us it was not a racist trial because many Moslems had also been arrested and indicted on the same charge along with the thirteen Jews .
But the trial opening today only involves the Jews.They are being tried separately from the Moslems charged with them , which proves , if proof were needed , that this trial - which we are told is to be adjourned - is no genuine trial .
You will remember , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , and it has been mentioned , that some Iranian Jews were arrested for spying for Israel a few years ago .
They were put on trial for it and hanged .
Who are the accused ?
We should point out that they include a cobbler , a cemetery caretaker , a boy who is not even sixteen yet , and two old men .
It is hard to understand how these people are endangering Iranian democracy .
What are they supposed to have done ?
No one really knows !
We do not have the right to know what they are supposed to have done .
A letter to a family in Israel may have been enough to set this case in motion .
In a previous resolution and in repeated letters supported by the President , we asked to be allowed to visit the prisoners .
That was refused .
We then asked to meet the families who are not sworn to secrecy , as far as I know .
That was also refused .
We asked - in a unanimous resolution - to be able to attend the trial .
Up to now that has been refused .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we must recognise the immense risk run by these thirteen people and strenuously reiterate our requests to send observers to this trial and be given access to the evidence in the case.We must also make clear our intransigence on relations with Iran .
I hope we are not going to wake up , some day soon , and find that these thirteen people have been executed because they were Jewish .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance wholeheartedly supports the joint resolution that will be put to the vote today .
I agree with all the previous speakers .
But I also support the massive protests that have been taking place for some time throughout the world in connection with this affair , such as today at 6 p.m. in Brussels in front of the Iranian embassy .
Today is a special day , 13 April 2000 , the date of the so-called &apos; trial &apos; .
In 1979 , 1993 , 1998 and 1999 , resolutions were sent from the European Parliament to Iran , but what happened to them ?
Via Amnesty International , Jewish families and organisations , we learned that , on 8 March 1999 , thirteen Iranian Jews and Muslims were arrested and detained .
The youngest is sixteen years old and the oldest forty eight .
The reason : espionage .
Yet again .
Requests have been made to send letters , but to no avail .
The Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs , David Levy , sent a letter to various ministers , including the Belgian Minister , to point out that these people are in no way guilty of spying .
They are Hebrew teachers and perform religious rituals , among other things .
Three of the thirteen have been allowed to choose a lawyer and the others have had lawyers forced upon them .
I heard today at 11.30 a.m. that the forum of Jewish organisations in Belgium says that there will not be a trial .
The Jewish communities are afraid .
What is likely to happen ?
People disappear , they are locked up , but for how long ? Either that or they are used for cattle trading .
It is very worrying and must be followed up .
I hope that Iran will act wisely and responsibly and not with hatred .
Mr President , we should be clear that already some 17 Jews have already been executed in Iran for charges of espionage , which basically involves no more than contacting anyone in the outside world , certainly anyone in Israel or the United States .
That seems to me an unacceptable position for any country that claims to respect human rights .
These 13 who were arrested were arrested in secret ; nobody knew of their whereabouts for two or three months .
In addition , these 13 were all religious leaders or leaders of the Jewish community .
Therefore , we can only interpret this trial as a deliberate attack on the Jewish community in Iran .
We know that there will not be a free trial ; it will not be open to the public and we have no idea whether these people will have representation .
Let us send our message very clearly from this Chamber .
If Iran claims to respect human rights , trials like this should never be allowed to happen .
- ( EL ) Mr President , we were most satisfied to see President Khatami &apos; s forces of modernisation strengthened during the recent elections in Iran .
At the same time , however , hopes were raised that there would be an acceleration in the processes of democratisation , respect for human rights without discrimination on the grounds of gender , religion or nationality and stronger dialogue with the European Union .
Unfortunately , the case of the 13 from the Jewish community , including a sixteen-year-old boy , is yet another link in the long chain of prosecutions , usually on trumped-up charges , intolerance and discrimination against minorities living in Iran .
Greece has started using its good relations with Iran to wage a campaign and to take steps to rescue the 13 .
We are using diplomatic channels to try and ensure that the death penalty is not imposed or , more to the point , is not carried out .
We feel that such an occurrence would put both relations between Israel and Iran and stability in the already sensitive Middle East to the test , which is why the European Parliament must send a strong message to Iran today , a message stressing the need to respect human rights , respect the international conventions which Iran has signed and grant a moratorium on the death penalty .
Akin Birdal
Mr President , Turkey is now standing at a crossroads .
It can choose the past , it can choose oppression and barbarity , or it can choose the future , freedom and humanitarianism .
Akin Birdal has now been imprisoned for such a statement , in spite of his ill-health .
We are faced with a country which apparently fears its own citizens so much that it is willing to violate the most basic human rights and place the unity of the state above the freedom and rights of the individual .
We must say to the Turkish Government that the policy which the country is conducting belongs to the past .
This type of behaviour does not belong to the future , where we hope that human rights will be foremost .
Such a country will never achieve the unity which it desires .
My advice to Turkey must be : choose the future and free Akin Birdal and his colleagues .
Mr President , in Helsinki , the EU countries confirmed Turkey &apos; s status as a candidate state .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supported this proposal .
We hope that we shall one day be able to welcome Turkey into the Community .
We believe that this message gives an important signal to the Turkish people .
But - and it is an important but - before negotiations can begin , a good many changes are required in Turkey , especially with regard to human rights .
Many of us had hoped for improvements in this area .
It is therefore all the more distressing to study all the reports about atrocities which arrive on an almost daily basis .
Turkey has signed international agreements on human rights but , as has become bitterly apparent to journalists , writers , human rights activists and opposition politicians , these are not observed .
We in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party wish especially to express our concern about the chairman of Turkey &apos; s Human Rights Foundation , Akin Birdal .
He had scarcely received a just trial and had been sentenced on flimsy grounds .
Following a period of freedom , he has again been imprisoned and is being denied the proper medical care he needs following the severe injuries he suffered in the attempt on his life in 1998 .
He must be released immediately .
In the EU , we are proud not merely to be an economic club .
The EU is a Union founded upon values , respect for human rights , democracy and the principles of the constitutional state .
Everyone , both existing and future members , must respect these criteria .
Unfortunately , Turkey still has a long way to go .
Mr President , during the debate the day before yesterday with the Council and the Commission , I mentioned the savage reaction of certain Turkish leaders to the fear that the European Union might try to interfere in internal Turkish affairs on the Kurdish question , at the very moment when a new path to membership is opening up for Turkey .
I can only repeat here as firmly as possible what I said in Ankara on my last visit there .
The European Parliament has no intention whatsoever of allowing the micro-nationalist miasma which has just drenched the Balkans in blood to develop in Turkey .
Turkish public opinion need have no fear of our being tempted to encourage any separatist claims whatsoever .
On the other hand , the values we subscribe to include respect for human dignity the world over and the right of European citizens to keep their roots in their native soil and in the culture of their upbringing .
At any rate , that is my interpretation of minority rights .
We are not trying to tell anyone what to do , but we must constantly reaffirm that the European Union - as Mrs Malmström said - is not just about creating wealth at home.There are many of us in this House who believe we must go on building Europe to promote and uphold its fundamental values , in the spirit of the founding fathers .
That is the purpose of the draft resolution we will be voting on shortly .
Mr President , two weeks ago , we met Akin Birdal in Ankara at the offices of the EU delegation .
These were his words to us then : &quot; For five months we have had a new Turkey .
Now that the country has acquired candidate country status , we see opportunities for democracy and freedom in our country .
In addition , the internal armed conflict has ceased and our relations with Greece have improved &quot; .
Those were Akin Birdal &apos; s words .
Akin Birdal was free at just that particular time because of what was termed &apos; ill health &apos; .
However , he would shortly be forced to return to prison if he were too healthy .
He also , of course , forfeited the right to be chairman of the Human Rights Foundation .
His so-called crime was that he had spoken about the Kurdish people on World Peace Day .
Because of this crime , and in accordance with Article 312 of the law in force , he was sentenced to one year &apos; s imprisonment and ordered to pay fines .
Akin Birdal is a gentle and peaceful man .
He still suffers from the after-effects of the attempt upon his life in the spring of 1998 .
In the course of our conversation , he said that he wanted democracy and a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question and that he saw the value of EU membership .
He also commented on how important it was to abolish 152 laws and articles which limit freedom of expression and cause so many people to be put in prison .
Mr Birdal was re-imprisoned the day after our conversation and after we had spoken with Prime Minister Ecevit about him .
What we are seeing in this case is how an undemocratic system imprisons , persecutes and oppresses democrats .
That is why , in our resolution , we are demanding that measures be taken swiftly to guarantee freedom of expression , reform the judicial system and release all political prisoners .
Mr President , the previous speaker made it easy for me because he spoke in detail about Akin Birdal who was the leader of the human rights organisation in Turkey and who is mainly known for calling for a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question .
In 1998 , he survived an assassination attempt by right-wing extremists , but since then his health has greatly deteriorated .
He is now in prison again , at the very time that a number of our MEPs visited Ankara .
From Mr Schörling &apos; s statement , it appears very clear that this is in no way coincidental .
It is real provocation .
Through this kind of action Turkey alienates itself from Europe .
The gulf becomes deeper instead of the other way round .
If Turkey wishes to heed our call , then it can only respond by releasing Mr Birdal because this is out-and-out provocation .
This is not the only instance of human rights violations that concern us .
I understand that a press bureau in Amsterdam has been ransacked and that this was formally sanctioned by the Belgian judiciary .
In the meantime we also know from incidents in Belgium who is really behind this .
Human rights are unambiguous , human rights are the same everywhere and Turkey must also be aware of that , otherwise it will never become a Member of the European Union .
Mr President , once again we protest and call upon the Turkish Government to release a prisoner who is guilty of the desire to live in a country where democracy , rights and freedom are truly respected .
Akin Birdal is not a Kurd.He is a Turk , a man of peace , condemned for speaking out about the Kurdish issue and calling for an end to this dirty war .
His imprisonment is the product of an illiberal legal system , the abolition of which Turkish democrats are fighting for , a legal system which has made hundreds and hundreds of citizens suffer .
No one who has met him could forget his smile and gentle nature .
And yet he has had to endure great suffering .
This is not the first time he has been arrested and an armed attack has been made on his life ; he escaped with his life , but he was unable to leave the country and was rearrested .
Leyla Azan is still in prison , and so are thousands of Kurds .
When will this end ?
There is no justification for the behaviour of the Turkish Government .
The KWP has stopped fighting and its leader , Mr Öçalan , is calling from jail for peace , reconciliation and recognition of the cultural identity of his people .
The European Union has accepted Turkey &apos; s candidacy and now the Turkish Government must respect our agreements and conventions .
We must explore every possible avenue , save military interventions and embargoes , starting with a refusal to sell Turkey any more arms , so that , at last , democracy and freedom can be established in Turkey .
Tibet
Mr President , from all accounts , the human rights situation in China has deteriorated considerably .
This is especially true of Tibet , where , for the time being , the Dalai Lama &apos; s reasonable five point plan has no chance of finding its way onto the agenda .
The European Union cannot continue to turn a blind eye .
The United States presented a resolution on the violation of human rights in China at the fifty-sixth session of the UN Commission on Human Rights .
We are extremely concerned by the fact that the Council of the Union has also not yet announced its intention to support this resolution , and this may not be coincidental , since the EU-China dialogue on human rights is at a complete standstill .
We call for an end to this policy of turning a blind eye to events in China , and for the European Union to join the American initiative without worrying about losing choice economic opportunities , and to cease this silent and tolerant stance towards the continuous violations of human rights in China , and , in particular , Tibet .
Europe is laboriously and extremely inconsistently shaking off her lethargic attitude to the horrors taking place in Chechnya .
I sincerely hope that she will follow the example of the United States and , at last , wake up to the human rights situation in China .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , two weeks ago an interparliamentary conference on the human rights situation in China was held at the European Parliament in Brussels .
We Members of the European Parliament agreed , together with the Foreign Minister of the Tibetan government in exile , the US government official responsible for Tibet and members of national parliaments , that it is time we put an end to shady compromises with China for the sake of maintaining purely economic relations .
The Chinese are still refusing to enter into a constructive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama , and political repression is on the increase .
People are being mercilessly persecuted , and religious freedom and freedom of speech are being curbed .
Tibet &apos; s culture and identity are being systematically obliterated .
These continual violations of the most fundamental human rights must now become an issue .
The United States needs the support of the European Union at the 56th UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva .
The European Union must use its inherent authority to work for human dignity and minority rights .
If it takes the first step , other countries , including the candidate countries , will certainly follow suit .
My own group , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , is firmly convinced of this .
Commissioner Lamy , Europe needs to stick its head above the parapet .
The Commission and the Council belong at the head of a movement fully supporting the Dalai Lama &apos; s five-point peace plan .
Point one : Tibet must become a peace zone .
Point two : China must finally renounce its policy of expulsion .
Point three : democratic civil rights must be guaranteed for all minorities .
Point four : Tibet &apos; s culture and environment must be protected .
Point five : genuine negotiations must take place on Tibet &apos; s future autonomous status .
Commissioner , all our economic agreements with third countries need to be based on the same premise : respect for human rights .
You demonstrated in Seattle , Commissioner Lamy , and I was there to see for myself , that you know how to build bridges .
How did a Tibetan delegate put it ?
&quot; We will survive because of your moral support , but above all because of your solidarity &quot; !
Tashi delek !
Mr President , as you are calling on each Member in his own language , perhaps you could address me in Bavarian !
Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet .
In 1992 , I presented a motion for a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the European Parliament .
It is with some dismay that I have realised today that eight years later the same motion for a resolution could be presented on the same grounds , lamenting the same poor , nay appalling , conditions in Tibet .
The Tibetans &apos; human rights are being trampled upon and their cultural and spiritual heritage is being threatened with complete extinction , especially in Tibet itself .
Nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before .
Millions of Tibetans have no human rights , let alone civil rights.Above all , they have no right of assembly , no freedom of association , and no right to freely practise their religion .
For this reason we are calling on the Chinese Government as a matter of the greatest urgency to seek a political solution for Tibet through discussions with Tibet &apos; s political and religious leaders , on the basis of the proposal made by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama .
Mr Mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this .
But I would like to stress this point : if a people is prepared to fight for its autonomous status without questioning borders and without separatist tendencies , then we should really be supporting them , as they are setting an example for our own European Union model !
Mr Sakellariou , unfortunately , the seriousness of this subject prevents me from responding to your introductory comment with some Bavarian humour.This subject is so serious that I think it would be out of place .
A great many people are involved here .
Mr President , today we are discussing Tibet , but we have also discussed Chechnya , Kurdistan and Taiwan , and we will continue to do so .
In my opinion , the reason for this is that when we talk of human rights , we always focus on individual rights and too often disregard the rights of peoples .
The fundamental right of self-determination is all too often ignored , possibly for reasons of political convenience .
It may be easier to act in defence of a person who has been wrongfully imprisoned , tortured or denied freedom of speech than in defence of an entire people .
But this is the crux of the matter : until the right of self-determination is declared and applied everywhere , we will continue to witness such situations and we will continue to debate and adopt resolutions , but , as Mr Sakellariou said , sadly , nothing will change .
We must change our perspective completely and progress from the protection of individuals to the protection of peoples , for it is not fair for the inhabitants of East Timor alone to be able to exercise this right : all peoples must have the facility to exercise this right if they so desire , from the Sahara to Chechnya , from Taiwan to Kurdistan , and , of course , in Tibet .
I am sure a large majority of the House agrees with you .
Death penalty in the United States
Mr President , as I am sure you are aware , at the moment there is much talk of the reform of the urgent debates , and there are certain influential members of the larger groups who see these debates as unnecessary and consider our resolutions to be somewhat superfluous .
And yet I would argue that no topic more than the death penalty in the United States has proved that this type of humble debate can , over time , play a major role.Things are changing in the United States .
I would not presume for a moment to think that this is entirely due to the European Parliament , but I feel that it is partly the result of the attention constantly paid to the matter by our institution .
I do not see the motion for a resolution that we are about to vote on as simply yet another resolution , but as further proof that things can change.Moreover , I believe that the three elements which are highlighted as positive in this resolution - the stances adopted by Janet Reno , the governor of Illinois and the U.S. Justice Department - should be brought to the attention of the Americans .
From this point of view , I feel we can congratulate ourselves .
Mr President , you could say that there is something of a feeling of helplessness in standing here yet again and talking about the death penalty in the USA , since it is certainly not the first time we have discussed it , not even the first time during my short period in Parliament .
Most recently , we discussed the Mumia Jamal case , and now it is the Juan Raul Garza case , among others .
However , these men are just examples as there have been so many that you could say that the USA , in its legal policy , is almost waging war against its most destitute and most marginalised people .
In this way the USA has brought itself into line with China , Congo and Iraq .
You may well feel that it is strange to sit in a near half-empty chamber , apart from the visitors , and discuss such an important subject , but I think it is a subject which we must continue to take up , and I would ask the Member States to also respond to it here , to respond swiftly and in no uncertain terms to this so-called friendly state which repeatedly violates the most basic human rights .
Mr President , the European Parliament has , on various occasions , approved texts which state that the death penalty is an assault on human dignity , on human rights and it is a great pity that we have to establish once again that the death penalty still exists among our American friends and that , regrettably , the number of executions is increasing - there have been 350 since 1990 .
What I find particularly distressing is the fact that young people as well , people under 18 , can also be sentenced to death , and even the mentally handicapped can be sentenced to death .
Those are particularly depressing aspects of the text now before us .
Every execution is an irreversible act and that makes it so extraordinary .
In the case we are discussing here it was not life imprisonment that was imposed , but the death penalty , and that is on the basis of facts that were not proven beyond any doubt .
For that reason even the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked for time to re-examine the case and to be able to issue an opinion , and it also asked that no date be set for an execution .
We must urge the Americans to act not only in this specific case , but to ensure that the death penalty is abolished in their country .
Together with a few other countries where democracy is a long way off , they are the only ones where the number of death sentences is rising .
This is by no means an enviable record .
Our Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has repeatedly argued in favour of the abolition of the death penalty , not only in this specific case , but in general .
More specifically , I would ask our American friends to abolish it once and for all .
Mr President , we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important .
Firstly , we all know that there is a wave of judicial executions across the USA - over 600 since 1977 - but this would be the first federal execution since 1963 .
Secondly , it is important because this is the only case since executions resumed in 1977 in which the evidence of unsolved , unadjudicated crime in a foreign country has been used to secure the death sentence .
Juan Garza &apos;s death sentence came as a result of murders in Mexico , which he was never charged with .
Thirdly , there are 21 prisoners currently in federal death row : 14 are black , 5 are white , one is Asian and one is Latino .
We know that in state trials black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants .
Fourthly , Governor Ryan of Illinois , as we have heard already , has imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in his state because of its appalling record of wrongful convictions .
When we bring all those factors together we see that the death penalty in the US is an arbitrary process and is fundamentally a racist process .
That is why we constantly demand that the death sentence should not be carried out in the US .
In this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 1963 .
That is why we urge President Clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions .
There is a presidential campaign under way .
In a presidential campaign executions , regrettably , become a political football in the US .
President Clinton has the opportunity - he is not standing for re-election - to make a stand on this issue today .
Mr President , I join with previous speakers in demanding the immediate and unconditional abolition of the death penalty in the United States , and everywhere else in the world .
The death penalty is a political arm used by the American Government apparatus to settle accounts with militants like Mumia Abu Jamal .
Like the whole prison system , it is also an instrument of social discrimination because Afro-Americans , ethnic minorities , and more generally the poor , are far more at risk than others of being condemned to death .
It is also a penalty whose irreversible character makes any reparation impossible if a mistake is made - and mistakes are often made .
A government which makes legal assassination one of the pillars of its justice system is infinitely more criminal than those it claims it is protecting society from .
The death penalty expresses all the barbarity of a society organised in a way that also condemns so many children and adolescents , even in the richest country in the world , to die from drug use or insecurity , actually from material and moral poverty , simply because they had the misfortune to be born in a poor area .
On a planetary scale , that barbarity condemns millions of human beings to die of hunger or disease when they could easily be cured - but they are not cured because they do not get the medicine they need .
In rising up against the death penalty we also rise up against all that barbarity , against the barbarity linked to permanently organising society so that all the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a minority and the great mass of humanity is condemned to poverty .
- ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the death penalty was abolished in Portugal over a century ago .
So for the Portuguese , being opposed to the death penalty is inherent in our culture .
I would like to remind you of another reference : the US Declaration of Independence , an inspirational text which defines the three rights on which the United States war of independence was based : &quot; the right to life , to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness &quot; .
Some two hundred years on , the right to life has still not been fully recognised in the US legal system and this deserves a strong reaction on our part .
Mr President , my Group firmly supports this resolution .
We owe a debt of gratitude to the USA for defeating two totalitarian regimes , for defeating national socialism and communism , and for establishing democracy and the rule of law throughout our continent.Nevertheless , the existence of the death penalty in the USA means that they could not join either the Council of Europe or the European Union .
That means that we should tell even such an important partner as this one , in no uncertain terms , that they should finally abolish the death penalty at individual state level and all the more so at federal level .
The American election campaign could provide a unique opportunity to send a strong message about this .
Sad to say , just the opposite has happened , and the candidates are vying with each other in a populist way on this issue .
However , we believe that the Atlantic Alliance is founded on democracy and the rule of law , so that the right to life should form the centrepiece of the legal system in both the USA and in Europe .
That is why we want to state unequivocally in our Charter of Fundamental Rights that we support the right to life and that we are opposed to a culture of death as typified by the death penalty .
Zimbabwe
Mr President , this short debate takes place against a background of increasing tension in Zimbabwe .
All of us who speak should remember that every word of our speeches and the resolution will be eagerly read in Zimbabwe within the next 48 hours by all sides .
We must , therefore , all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May .
The old parliament was dissolved on 11 April and President Mugabe pledged at the EU-Africa Summit in Cairo that the elections would go ahead .
It is therefore worrying that constituency boundaries have yet to be set .
This could take up to three months .
I hope that , when the elections are called , observers from Europe will be invited to Zimbabwe to monitor the proceedings .
This would show real transparency .
It is not for Europe to meddle in the internal affairs of any nation .
African countries must work together to consolidate their future .
However , the old Lomé Convention made democracy , human rights and the rule of law a requirement for development aid .
The new Partnership Agreement goes further and asks for good governance .
All we ask is that disputes of any kind be settled through courts and not in open conflict .
I particularly highlight land issues .
Zimbabwe has much to gain from the Partnership Agreement and urgently needs aid and debt relief .
Much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement .
It is disappointing that Zimbabwe feels the need to be involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo at a time when precious resources could be spent on domestic requirements , such as education and health .
We all look forward to the rule of law being strengthened and a democratisation process fully operating under an independent judiciary to allow civil society to express its wishes through a fair and open press .
The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future .
Mr President , in the last few decades Southern Africa has formed the subject of much attention in this House .
We have fortunately been able to witness a democratic regime that seems to function well coming to power in South Africa .
At the moment we are receiving very alarming reports from Zimbabwe .
There are clear signs that democracy in that country could be in jeopardy .
The court rulings were ignored .
I sincerely hope that the ruling that was taken about an hour ago , that the police must act against those occupying the farms , will not be ignored this time , as was unfortunately the case with other court rulings .
What is more serious is the fact that innocent people are being beaten for no apparent reason .
The only possible reason for this is that they oppose the government of President Mugabe .
All this , Mr President , is a recipe for anarchy and a threat to democracy that could endanger the entire region .
We therefore believe that elections must be held as quickly as possible , preferably under the supervision of international observers so that everyone can be satisfied that they are held as fairly as possible .
Land reform is necessary .
There are many landless farmers and unemployed people in Zimbabwe .
It must , however , take place lawfully .
Above all , it should not occur along racial lines and it must certainly not be the case that holders of political office of whatever party be given priority in the distribution of land .
Finally I should like to say something about the war that is currently raging in a certain part of Africa .
I agree with Mr Corrie that the money for this war could be better spent on development in Zimbabwe , on education , training and health care .
One can think of a whole range of things .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by expressing my confidence in the people of Zimbabwe .
These people have , over the last few years , shown that they deserve our confidence .
Zimbabwe is a country which , since independence in 1980 , has steadily chosen the path of peaceful development under the leadership of President Mugabe .
Not only in the economic sphere , but also politically , with a degree of press freedom in which the leadership of the country has also not been spared from criticism .
As one of the leading SADEC countries it was at the forefront of the battle against apartheid in South Africa .
It would be particularly sad if this country of all countries became the victim of war , racism and civil strife .
Zimbabwe does , of course , still have considerable problems , but the European countries and the Union will continue to assume their responsibilities as partners of Zimbabwe in jointly tackling the problems of poverty , ill health and under-development .
These problems will not be resolved by letting the Zimbabwean army fight in the Congo .
The country cannot afford such a drain on its resources , as is evident from the economic situation .
Neither will the occupation of the land of white farmers resolve the problems .
Land reforms can be introduced through legal channels by a lawful government , and a lawful government comes to power after normal elections .
These have been announced for June at the very latest .
I hope that nobody will use the current problems as a pretext - by exaggerating and increasing these problems , for example - to postpone the elections and heavily influence the spontaneous development of this movement .
In my view , Zimbabwe deserves our confidence .
The population has chosen the path of development .
I hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an abrupt end to this .
With this in mind , we support the resolution .
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I should like to agree with the comments made by my fellow MEPs .
I believe that we have a reasonable common position .
Land reform is one of the most important issues throughout southern Africa , so it is therefore not surprising to see that it is again being exploited by Mugabe to his advantage , just prior to the elections , exactly as he has done in previous elections .
After all , this issue is so important for so many black and poor people .
The elections are therefore necessary .
The rule of law is necessary .
You need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly .
I support what other speakers have said about the SADAC countries who will no doubt be looking upon this situation with great concern and who are undoubtedly working behind the scenes to maintain a democratic climate .
It is also true that they are continually pressing for the withdrawal of troops from the Congo .
Could the Commission and the Council help us , as the European Parliament , to remain involved as observers at these elections , because if things go wrong in Zimbabwe , there will be more trouble in the region .
After South Africa and the democratic government there and the sound developments that have taken place in the region , we very much need to see the positive side .
Let us express our complete confidence in the Zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for 1 June .
Mr President , it is five to midnight in Zimbabwe .
Everything points to the country sitting on a volcano that could erupt at any minute .
In the run up to the elections , Mugabe will not hesitate to use violence against his political opponents .
At the beginning of this month , peaceful demonstrators were attacked by his followers while the police looked on .
What is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone .
Similarly , Mugabe will not recoil from provoking anarchy and racial hatred by encouraging the illegal occupation of white farms .
Whites are being systematically intimidated and driven from their land through violent means to punish them for their support for the opposition and to buy the votes of the landless farmers .
The government systematically disregards the rulings of the Supreme Court .
In fact , the public prosecutor warned that any attempt to remove the occupiers could lead to civil war .
It is clear that Mugabe , who has become unpopular through his mismanagement of the economy and his exploits in the Congo , intends to do everything necessary to stay in power .
Some people even fear that he is inciting the chaos in order to be able to proclaim a state of emergency and postpone the elections .
At long last , the European Union has this week threatened to suspend aid if the President does not keep his promise of free and fair elections .
But it is already clear that the elections have been rigged .
A quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates .
The President is still not allowing any foreign observers in .
What else has to happen before structural aid is suspended ?
I would urge the Council and the Commission not to wait until it is five past midnight .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think it is a shame that this resolution was not adopted at the March part-session , just as I think it is a shame that the recent EU-Africa Summit did not tackle this subject head on .
These are subjects which should be at the forefront of political action by the European Union .
We cannot hide the seriousness of what has been going on in Zimbabwe for many weeks now .
The fact is that Hitler is on the loose again - Hitler is out and about again there .
It should not go unnoticed that the leader of the band that is encouraging these arbitrary acts in Zimbabwe chose the name Hitler as his own name .
He is a gentleman by the name of Chenjerai &apos; Hitler &apos; Hunzvi .
We know that the instigator is the President of Zimbabwe himself , but the leader of the movement took this name , a name that we know all too well from the horrors of our own history.This is what is happening in Zimbabwe .
That is why we have to take more vigorous action .
The chaos , the threats and the intimidation taking place in that country are unacceptable and it is also unacceptable that this is being encouraged by the person holding the highest office of state , the President of Zimbabwe himself .
Mr President , I will comment on the various issues that have been dealt with during the debate , starting with Iran .
The concern expressed in Parliament &apos; s motions for resolutions on human rights in Iran is entirely shared by the Commission .
Like you , we are particularly worried about the fate of the thirteen Jewish and eight Moslem Iranians detained under this strange charge of espionage .
A number of approaches were made last year by the Union and by various Member States .
Consultations at Union level are continuing , along the lines of the motions for resolutions , in order to establish the most likely ways of guaranteeing the fair and just trial we all hope to see .
Further approaches and the possible presence of observers at the trial could , in our view , be part of that perspective .
So we share the attitude expressed in the debate by those of you who said that , given the progress observed in Iran since the recent parliamentary election , we should , as far as humanly possible , avoid giving the impression of foreign interference which could be counterproductive and which might reverse the improvement we believe we are seeing in the internal and external political climate .
On the subject of Akin Birdal , again we fully share the concerns that have been expressed during the debate and in the resolution on the return to prison of Akin Birdal , ostensibly to complete his sentence .
We entirely support the declaration of 30 March by the Union Presidency , inviting the Turkish Government to take steps to secure the release of this activist .
As you mentioned during the debate , the Helsinki European Council confirmed Turkey &apos; s status as a candidate country on the basis of the same criteria that apply to the other candidate countries .
So it is important for Turkey to engage resolutely in the democratisation process and adopt the necessary reforms in terms of human rights .
Revision , or even repeal , of Article 312 of the criminal code , which was referred to earlier and which is the basis on which Mr Birdal was found guilty of , and I quote , &quot; incitement to hatred &quot; , seems absolutely essential in this respect .
In the context of the regular report it has been producing since 1998 for Turkey , like the other candidate countries , the Commission is following the human rights situation very closely .
In our last report , published in October 1999 , we were already expressing our concern about the provisional nature of Mr Birdal &apos; s release , with good reason , unfortunately .
So we will continue to follow up the matter , in the context of the detailed examination we carry out every year .
As you know , we are currently working on a membership partenariat with Turkey , within the framework of the pre-accession strategy .
This document , which establishes the list of priorities to be met by Turkey in preparation for membership , should be adopted by the Commission next November .
By the end of the year , Turkey will need to adopt a national programme reflecting its own priorities for the partenariat and listing the resources put in place to achieve them .
So we have some important deadlines coming up and , in the Commission &apos; s view , questions relating to the democratisation process , in particular freedom of expression , will have an important place in the examination of this partenariat .
As regards human rights in Tibet , we also share your concern .
Like you we are worried about the cultural , linguistic and religious identity of the autonomous region of Tibet , which the Chinese authorities clearly do not respect .
As we have done , with you , many times before , we call on China to re-enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
We regard the renewal of this dialogue as the only realistic method of achieving a peaceful and durable solution to the Tibetan question .
To respond to Mr Mann , the Union has raised these matters many times in the context of the specific bilateral dialogue it is holding with China on human rights .
The situation in Tibet was also one of the main items on the agenda at the last summit between the Union and China , held in Beijing last December .
We will doggedly continue to raise the case of Tibet with the Chinese authorities .
On the death penalty in the United States , like many of you , the Commission is concerned about the growing number of people condemned to death and executed in the United States since the reintroduction of the death penalty in 1976 .
In 1998 , opposition to the death penalty became one of the most high profile factors in the whole of Union policy on human rights .
We are engaged in permanent dialogue , not only with the United States Government , but also with the other American authorities concerned , in particular the governors of the states where the death penalty has not been abolished .
The Commission is delighted with the Governor of Illinois &apos; decision to establish a moratorium on all executions pending in that state , and we hope that decision will mark an important stage on the road to the abolition of the death penalty in Illinois .
The risk of condemning innocent people to death , mentioned by Mr Ryan , Governor of Illinois , is one of the essential principles underlying the Union &apos; s position on the death penalty .
And we are hoping - we have started - to encourage all the federal states in the United States which apply capital punishment to think about that risk and introduce a moratorium like the one in Illinois with a view to achieving abolition of the death penalty throughout the country .
With regard to the particular case of Juan Miguel Garza , the Commission is currently working to clarify the facts through our delegation to Washington .
On the basis of that clarification , and in accordance with the 1998 guidelines , the Commission will decide whether a specific approach to the American authorities is needed .
The American authorities should be expecting one.They are fully aware of the whole Union &apos; s opposition to the death penalty and all executions .
Finally , Zimbabwe .
I will rapidly pick up the four points that have been raised in the debate : the elections , the future of our cooperation , the intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo and finally the violence perpetrated in connection with agrarian reform .
Our main concern is the organisation of free and democratic elections .
As regards the possibility of sending a team of electoral observers from the European Union , the Commission recognises the long experience of the European Parliament and the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly in this type of exercise , and particularly that of certain Members of Parliament who are present and who have spoken in this debate .
All the same , we doubt whether such an initiative would be effective in view of the uncertainty surrounding the election preparations .
At this stage , one aid formula would be to intensify civic education , local training and observation of the elections.The Commission is involved in the last stage of a project designed to train over a thousand local supervisors of the electoral process and we have made contact with our partners from the Southern African Development Community , SADEC , to define their role , and find out whether sending in an observation team from SADEC could be envisaged .
As regards the question concerning the possible suspension of our cooperation , although there could be grounds for suspending financial cooperation with Zimbabwe under the Lomé Convention , we take the view , for the moment , as indeed does Mrs Maes , that such a measure would run counter to our goal prior to the elections .
Since the government &apos; s macroeconomic results are mediocre to say the least , the Commission , the IMF , and the World Bank have already frozen their support for structural adjustment , and the backers participating in the agrarian reform have suspended their institutional cooperation plans .
We have done that , but we continue to support the population re-establishment programmes aimed at combating poverty , and we think it is appropriate to maintain the anti-poverty aid approved in the 8th EDF framework for the social sectors .
On Zimbabwe &apos; s intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo , we support the Lusaka peace agreement which calls for a status quo of the forces present and a ceasefire in line with the terms of that agreement .
Finally , as regards agrarian reform , since February the Union has been taking various steps in reaction to the recent deplorable events in the country , presumably at the instigation of the Zimbabwe government , such as the violent occupation of farms and non-respect for diplomatic immunity .
In the last few weeks there has clearly been an intensification of illegal occupation and an increase in violence and intimidation , particularly directed against the opposition .
Regrettably , we interpret these disturbances as forming part of the governing party &apos; s election campaign .
Like the European Parliament , we utterly deplore them .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Lamy .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
World education forum
Mr President , The World Education Forum in Dakar is a follow-up to the first conference of Education for All held in Thailand eleven years ago .
There has been some progress but , unfortunately , not enough as yet .
As we speak there are 125 million children in the world who do not go to school .
There are 880 million illiterate adults , two-thirds of whom are girls and women .
The Community is the largest donor to many of these countries .
It is regrettable that we are not sending our highest official to attend that conference on behalf of the Community .
We also regret that there has not yet been a communication on children &apos;s rights from the Commission .
A prominent African leader made a very pertinent comment .
He said that education is the only existing vaccination against AIDS .
One of the main problems with providing education in many countries is the catastrophic effect AIDS is having on the lives not just of children , many of whom are orphans because they have lost one or both parents .
In several of the African countries which I recently visited , I was informed that in order to have one teacher , the colleges must train three , because by the age of 30 so many teachers are already dead from AIDS .
This underlines the seriousness of the problems .
Many of these children who are not in school are working .
Future plans for education programmes and commitments on the part of the donors to the developing world will have to take this into consideration .
Unfortunately , only 2 % of the aid we send to these developing countries is actually being spent on education .
We hope very much that this conference will raise the issue again and bring to it the urgent attention that is needed .
Mr President , for about ten years I have been involved with campaigns to promote education throughout the world .
A hundred and twenty-five million children , mainly girls , do not receive any education .
I am extremely pleased that I am now a Member of the European Parliament and can take specific action and that in this resolution all Groups are saying that the EU development cooperation budget should be doubled .
We are not talking about more money for the development budget but about redistribution within that budget .
According to Commissioner Nielson , we spend 5 % on education as a whole and an estimated 80 % of that on primary education .
Because I am also rapporteur for the budget for the year 2001 , I hope that we as a Parliament , in consultation with Commissioner Nielson - who has , moreover , said that he wants to move in this direction - will be able to double that budget next year .
That would really be a concrete step forward , because so much of the money that we spend simply does not reach the poorest people and is not a step towards real development .
Finally , we cannot develop others , they must develop themselves , but this is a wonderful opportunity to help them and Parliament , together with the Commission , will soon be able to translate this resolution very specifically into real action in the 2001 budget .
Mr President , it is incredibly sad and , in fact , humiliating for us all that , in the year 2000 , there are still children who do not receive any basic education or schooling at all and that there are still adults - almost a billion of them - who cannot read or write and who are thus also prevented from participating in the political and democratic life of their society .
It is , of course , also a waste of human resources that this is the way things are .
Unfortunately , it is also those countries which most need educated people to participate in the democratic development of civil society which lack resources for education .
As has been mentioned , the world &apos; s governments agreed in 1990 that steps should be taken to ensure that everyone received a basic education by no later than the year 2000 .
At the Copenhagen Summit , the deadline was changed to 2015 .
Now , a new summit looms , namely the World Education Forum in Dakar , Senegal in April .
We know that education is the key to combating poverty , promoting respect for human rights etc .
We cannot accept a situation in which the deadline by which everyone is to receive a basic education is moved forward once again .
I am pleased with this resolution .
I hope that the decision will be a unanimous one and that the clear message will be : ensure you establish a specific framework for a global action plan for prioritising educational needs in the world .
Make resources available .
This is also our message to the Commission .
Mr President , the recent Euro-African Summit in Cairo has made poverty one of our central concerns .
As the author of the general report on poverty approved in the Bahamas by the EU-ACP Joint Assembly a few months ago , I would like to say that the fight against poverty must become one of our objectives and , in many cases , our main objective .
In this context , education , together with health , is the tool with which we can implement an ambitious programme to win the fight against poverty in the world .
Education is a universal human right and the key to sustainable human development.It is the basic responsibility of the States and , above all , an achievable objective if we mobilise the necessary resources .
For this reason , we are supporting this initiative and we urge the Commission to mobilise the necessary budgetary and economic resources and to adopt the relevant institutional initiatives so that this objective may be achieved .
Mr President , I want to preface my remarks by saying that whenever there is lack of respect for children &apos; s rights , there is violence .
And the first form of violence is failure to provide education .
Children from families with problems suffer and often do not have access to proper education .
They will have far less chance of success in life and the conditions are all present for their children to experience the same situation .
So it is time to prioritise prevention and by creating a different family framework finally make it possible to avoid pointless social and individual suffering and implement a real policy of inclusion , socialisation and education from birth .
We need to invent new responses and new social attitudes .
It is our duty to take an interest in these children , particularly the girls , because in some countries they are still regarded as domestic slaves .
The importance of the early years and education must be recognised in order to provide young people with forms of self-expression other than rebellion due to deprivation in childhood .
Human beings are born in a state of dependency .
Defenceless , babies have no duties .
They cannot have any .
Duties follow awareness and awareness awakens with education .
So in parallel with the implementation of processes to promote literacy and education in general , we must also engage in some collective thinking about the living conditions of children in the various countries , especially in urban areas , and assist in projects to look after street children in third world countries , and also in our own countries , developing pilot schemes inspired , for example , by the family pre-school proposed by ATD Quart-monde .
It involves reaching out to families and helping children within the family , as well as cooperation and funding to help families in difficulty , especially single-parent families and vulnerable children .
In fact it is our duty to launch an extensive review of the education of children on our planet if we want a better future for all .
Mr President , the Commission has participated actively in the Forum &apos; s preparation process through the &apos; Education for All 2000 &apos; evaluation and the regional preparation meetings , particularly the one in Johannesburg in 1999.The Commission will be represented at the Dakar Forum by the director-general for Development .
In line with these international commitments , Community investments in education have primarily targeted basic education and primary education , especially in the context of cooperation with the ACP countries .
Thus , a majority of the education programmes financed under the 8th EDF have been devoted to primary education .
The funds allocated to this heading represent 80 % of the total amount devoted to education .
The Commission has incorporated the recommendations of the Jomtien Conference on Basic Education into its policy and , in the framework of indicative national programmes , 35 ACP countries out of 71 have made education a priority .
However , I have to specify that , while a balanced approach means prioritising basic education , as has been said , other levels of the educational system must not be neglected as a consequence .
We agree that the effectiveness of our approach on education requires very close coordination between the Community and the Member States as well as with the other backers .
But we believe we must also establish a dialogue with civil society and that will be the Community &apos; s approach to supporting national education action plans in ACP countries .
We are also pursuing the target of eliminating disparities affecting people by the year 2005 , in line with the OECD Development Aid Committee &apos; s strategy and the conclusions of the European Union &apos; s social affairs summits .
My last point is the question put by Mr Van den Berg on the doubling of the basic education budget in 2001 .
In our view , the Community and the Member States should all allocate more resources to education overall and to basic education in particular .
Nevertheless , we also know this cannot have the anticipated effect unless the recipient countries have the necessary absorption capacity and the resources to ensure the sustainability and durability of the system .
Consequently the answer is not &apos; no &apos; , but it is not entirely &apos; yes &apos; either .
We think the issue needs to be examined country by country to ensure adequate analysis adapted to each case .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Lamy .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Taiwan
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0347 / 2000 by Mr Collins , on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group ;
B5-0356 / 2000 by Mr Haarder and others , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party ;
B5-0372 / 2000 by Mr Jarzembowski and others , on behalf the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats ;
B5-0388 / 2000 by Mr Nogueira Román , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance
on Taiwan .
Mr President , the elected Vice-President of the island of Taiwan has been called &quot; the dregs of the nation &quot; by the government in Beijing .
Extra troops have been sent to the Chinese province of Fujian , which lies across the water from Taiwan .
This elected Vice-President , Annette L , said last week that although Taiwan and the mainland are very close to each other geographically , they had become distant relations over the course of history .
China reacted furiously .
Lü had shown her true colours as an extremist and incorrigible agitator for the independence of Taiwan .
According to Beijing , with her poisonous words she wanted to stir up her Taiwanese comrades to hate their fellow countrymen in the mother country , i.e. Beijing .
Lü said that these slanderous comments reminded her of the way in which the Kuomintang had treated her - during the long dictatorship of this party she was imprisoned for five years - and that she is only interested in improved relations with Beijing .
That is indeed the case .
We know Annette Lü and the new President of Taiwan Chen Shui-bian .
Their election is the crowning glory of the democratisation process in Taiwan .
Is that a threat to China ?
Yes , indeed , after all it is clear that the Chinese people are quite capable of building a democratic system with respect for human rights .
The Taiwanese have shown that .
For the old man in Beijing the internal developments in Taiwan must be a nightmare .
Do they really think their threats will bring results ?
Beijing &apos; s behaviour confirms our opinion that the future of Taiwan lies in the hands of the Taiwanese themselves .
As Europeans we do not need to interfere .
Our business is to ensure that this great and independent island is properly represented on the world stage , at the World Health Organisation , the World Trade Organisation , and such like .
The idea that Beijing could represent the Taiwanese in such organisations is absolutely ridiculous .
It is extremely important for this Parliament to forge closer links with the elected representatives in Taiwan .
Democratisation in that part of the world is also important for Europe .
China will only be able to be reunited if both Taiwan and the mainland adopt democracy , human rights and the rule of law as their guiding principles .
Mr President , Commissioner , as European Parliament observers , my colleague Georg Jarzembowski and I were able to follow the presidential elections in Taiwan on 18 March on the spot , &apos; live &apos; as it were .
On the basis of numerous conversations with various parties and visits to the polling stations , we satisfied ourselves that the election was free and democratic .
We had the impression that the elections in Taiwan were marked by a mature awareness of democracy amongst the population .
This was evidenced both by the high turnout , which , as compared with the presidential elections , had risen by 6 % to 82 % , and by the result itself .
After a very long period of supremacy by the party in government up to that point - a period lasting over 50 years - the political scene has been revitalised .
The opposition candidate was elected the new President and , for the first time in Taiwan &apos; s history , a woman was elected Vice-President .
These results alone mark a historical turning point .
The people of Taiwan viewed any attempts by outsiders to influence them with enormous sensitivity .
The result was primarily an expression of the internal policy debate , and the newly elected President , Mr Chen Shui-bian , based his election campaign almost entirely on internal issues , and the high-profile , aggressive and provocative noises emerging from the People &apos; s Republic of China , from a variety of sources , had , if anything , the opposite of the desired effect .
Nevertheless , everyone involved was aware of the circumstances .
Chen Shui-bian was also elected because the previously governing Kuomintang party was split by the presence of two candidates .
However , the Kuomintang still has a majority in the Taiwanese Parliament .
Chen Shui-bian is very well aware that a radical pro-independence policy would have been condemned to failure .
The region needs security and stability .
The only way to achieve reconciliation and lasting peace is through positive cooperation and a constructive dialogue between mainland China and Taiwan .
Healthy relations are also needed for economic development .
We therefore welcome the fact that both sides in this conflict are seeking a peaceful solution .
In this respect we welcome Chen Shui-bian &apos; s initiative to commence bilateral talks , and we also welcome the cooperative approach announced by the People &apos; s Republic of China .
The PRC is officially endeavouring to reach a peaceful solution , subject , of course , to Taiwan renouncing its efforts towards independence .
Our resolution is intended to further democracy in Taiwan , but the People &apos; s Republic of China is taking it as an affront .
That is why I seriously ask myself whether we should not perhaps adopt a different approach , based on reconciliation instead of polarisation .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , I would like to highlight this Group &apos; s contributions to the joint motion for a resolution , both in terms of promoting dialogue with the People &apos; s Republic of China and Taiwan , as well as in the firm position which has to be maintained on this issue .
We believe that there is an objective need for Taiwan to have a greater presence in the international institutions ; this Parliament can promote that .
We therefore support the existence of relations between this Parliament and the Taiwanese Parliament by means of the delegation from our institution and also the need to open a European Union information office in Taiwan .
Having said this , we also want this dialogue to have an objective basis , as have the declarations of the new President , Chen Shui-bian , to which , however , the People &apos; s Republic of China has replied with a renewed display of nervousness , arrogance and a disrespect for democracy .
We must reject these threats since they are absolutely unacceptable , but also because they are an objective threat to the dialogue which is so necessary to the resolution of this problem .
Mr President , thank you very much for letting me speak for the second time today .
The recent presidential elections , which not only observed all democratic norms but also marked the end of the 50-year rule of the Kuomintang , secured the presidency for Mr Chen Shui-bian .
The newly elected President reflects Taiwan &apos; s democratic maturity .
This makes the behaviour of the People &apos; s Republic of China all the more worrying for us , as before , during and after the democratic elections in Taiwan the Republic did not cease to make in some cases totally unacceptable threats towards its little brother .
I realise , of course , that the People &apos; s Republic of China does not understand the word democracy .
Nevertheless , there is no need for them to start panicking just because democratic elections are taking place in a neighbouring state .
Unfortunately , democracy is not infectious !
Mr President , like you , we are delighted that the people of Taiwan have been able to express a democratic choice for the second time .
As the Union has stated through its Presidency , most recently in July last year , in principle we are in favour of one China , but we also want the tension which breaks out from time to time between Taiwan and the People &apos; s Republic of China to be resolved peaceably within a constructive dialogue .
We call on both Beijing and Taipei to take the path of dialogue as quickly as possible .
We are encouraging intensification of economic relations with Taiwan and we think that should happen if , as we expect , Taiwan joins the World Trade Organisation .
Finally , we note the request in your draft resolution , also mentioned by Mr Knörr Borras , for an information office to be opened in Taipei .
We are hoping to do that , but we have not set any timetable because we have other priorities in Asia and worldwide , and you know how limited our resources are in this field , so we are forced to make choices .
We hope to open an office , but it is not one of our priorities at the moment .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 5.25 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )
We shall now proceed to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Relating to the joint resolution on Iraq
Mr President , there is a drafting error in Paragraph 2 of this resolution .
I would like to propose - and this is in fact correct in the German version - that we should forward this resolution to the High Representative for the CFSP .
But it then continues : &quot; forward this resolution ... and the governments of the Member States &quot; .
I would like to propose an oral amendment so that it reads &quot; and the governments of the Member States , of the United States and of Iraq &quot; .
This is an oral amendment .
Are there any objections ?
If there are no objections , Mr Sakellariou &apos; s motion will be adopted .
Mr President , I should like to clarify whether this resolution is compatible with the resolution that we passed in January of this year , drawing attention to the problems of the prisoners of war who are still in Kuwait , or whether this resolution is to be taken as contradictory to our resolution of January of this year ?
Mr Perry , your objection is political , not procedural .
Mr Sakellariou tabled a motion ; nobody opposed it and so the motion has been adopted .
Mr President , this morning we had a debate on whether or not , in future , the House should meet in plenary on Fridays .
A possible justification cited in favour of change was that the agenda is generally relatively uninteresting and that something should be done about this .
For that reason , and in order to establish whether a quorum is guaranteed on Thursday afternoon when there is an interesting agenda and very important votes , I request that you establish the quorum .
Mr Markov , you cannot make this request on your own .
The request has to be made by 32 Members .
If this request is made by 32 Members , I can check on the quorum .
Thirty-nine or 40 Members appear to have stood up , and so we must check on the quorum .
Mr President , given that agreement was reached on this subject , I find this a rather crude method of avoiding such an important vote .
Mr Naïr , the method may be crude as you say , but the problem is that , according to the old Rules of Procedure , a certain number of Members could request the quorum and then leave the Chamber .
The current rule is that whoever requests the quorum has to remain in the Chamber .
Other Members could have requested the quorum and then not voted .
Consequently , all this may well be crude but it is just a touch more practical .
Mr President , I think it is terribly sad that when we are about to take such important votes some people are trying to obstruct this .
I have heard that some Parliamentary staff worked until 4 a.m. so that we could vote on the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen report .
I would like to sincerely thank those staff on behalf of my Group , and , I hope , on behalf of all of us .
They work very conscientiously and we should be just as conscientious when it comes to voting !
( Loud applause )
Thank you , Mr Swoboda.However , this is a possibility provided by the Rules of Procedure , and any Member has the right to avail himself or herself of it .
Mr President , I think we should vote .
Just one comment if I may : I understand that on various occasions colleagues may want to test the quorum .
Would you ask the President to invite the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to consider a change to the Rules so we can check it electronically ?
Mr Cox , do you really think we can make this change to the Rules of Procedure now ?
Mr President , I can understand the reasoning behind not being able to do it electronically , because you cannot check whether everyone uses their card .
I can understand why you would have to take a head count .
I would like to know exactly how many people you counted in the chamber today ?
Straight in front of me I can see at least four people , just in this row here , who are Group staff - not Members .
How can you , from up there , see exactly which people are Members and which are staff and what the actual figures are ?
Ms McKenna , the services of our Chamber are quite familiar with us Members , and also with the collaborators who are authorised to enter the Chamber : they recognise each and every one of them very well .
If you are in agreement , I would like to proceed with the vote .
Other Members are asking for the floor , but if we continue we will be opening a debate which is completely unrelated to the matter in hand .
Let us proceed to the vote .
Relating to the joint resolution on Chechnya
Mr President , I rise to speak about the vote on the Chechen resolution .
During the debate and also during the efforts to agree on a compromise amendment , it emerged that there is a large majority who are of the same view as regards policy and substance .
It can only be a matter of tactics if , at this stage , having adopted six resolutions already , we say the same thing , or virtually the same thing , once again without any serious debate with the Council and with the Commission .
For this reason I would like to make this appeal to Members in the other groups : first of all , let us send the joint delegation to Chechnya .
Everyone has agreed to this specific proposal .
And then , when the delegation has returned , we can hold a major debate on Chechnya in conjunction with the Council and the Commission , and at the end of that debate .....
( The President cut the speaker off )
At the request of Mr Sakellariou , the motion for resolution B5-0350 / 2000 has been withdrawn .
Vote ( continuation )
Mr President , since this voting session is a continuation of the lunch-time voting session , would I be correct in thinking that the few roll-call votes in which we have participated this afternoon will count as part of our daily count , and that this has direct relevance to the earlier vote on whether we had a quorum or not ?
Perhaps you could let me know later .
Mr President , I just wanted to ask why we are not voting on Ethiopia now .
Mr Swoboda , the vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning .
Mr President , now the vote is over , I would like to come back to the issue of a quorum .
I do not think you would need a head count unless you did a test with cards and got below what is required .
It would save time if you tried that first .
For example , today there were 226 in the first vote after the issue of the quorum was raised .
If there had been a check with cards , maybe we could have avoided the problem of having a head count .
Ms McKenna , this is not an issue that can be resolved right now in this Chamber .
Both your interventions - this one and the one you made earlier - have been recorded .
We will have to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to amend the Rules of Procedure .
It is not an issue that we can deal with now .
Mr President , I voted for the definition of the &quot; Youth &quot; Community action programme , as agreed in the Conciliation Committee , mainly because it will finance and implement the European voluntary service programme , which has a large number of young people involved in community actions , including the provision of assistance for the elderly .
Having said this , I would like to put forward a suggestion for future discussions on the &quot; Youth &quot; project and point out something which concerned me in the vote , although the report was adopted , and that is the definition of the word &quot; youth &quot; .
Mr President , do you feel young ?
I think you are saying that you do .
In my opinion , it would be appropriate to establish that &quot; young &quot; means those who are young at heart , and therefore give those who are no longer young in years but who are young at heart the opportunity to take advantage of these services .
.
( PT ) We have been discussing this programme for too long , with all the consequences that that delay implies , as all this effort has not been reflected in the budget agreed in the conciliation procedure - EUR 520 million for seven years , whereas the European Parliament &apos; s original proposal was for EUR 980 million - which is quite frankly less than the programme requires .
On the other hand , whilst the accession of the candidate countries will give more young people access to the YOUTH programme and there will be an even richer exchange of experience , I have some doubts about whether the budget for the programme is enough to guarantee the success of this initiative .
Although the initial phase of this programme has been positive , its scope is very limited , as it relates to just one facet of the youth policy that we need , which should actually tackle the various issues affecting young people - such as education , employment , housing , health and culture - across the board .
The references to ways of solving the problems of discrimination and to the age range for participation in the programme - 15-25 , although there are some exceptions - are also inadequate , given that the average age for completing higher education is very close to the upper limit , which should be raised to 30 years .
Lastly , it is important to strengthen the role and obligations of the bodies responsible for promoting the programme in each Member State , to make sure that it is promoted as efficiently and as quickly as possible .
- I was disappointed to see that in the decision of Parliament and Council establishing the &quot; Youth &quot; Community action programme , reference to the family has been removed in final conciliation negotiations .
This reference , which was accepted by the Culture and Youth Committee as well as Parliament , referred to the need to examine the role of the family among those factors which have promoted and hampered the social integration of young people .
The importance of the family in promoting or hampering social integration among youth is clearly recognised within society today , as well as through various studies .
The Council of Europe , in its report Coherent and Integrated Family Policies , states , &quot; Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values , standards , customs and behaviour of the social groups to which their children belong &quot; .
It is inexcusable that this reference to the family has been removed .
In a report designed to assess and support our young people in the best possible way , the deletion of reference to the family , the single most important influence in a young person &apos; s life , is incomprehensible .
- I wholeheartedly endorse Mrs Gröner &apos;s recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on European youth action programmes .
The previous youth programmes , Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service , will be grouped together in a general medium-term programme which will run from 2000 until 2006 , as the European Parliament has demanded .
A longer-term programme will ensure young people have the opportunity to benefit from such schemes for a guaranteed time .
Every participant will also have full access to health services and social security , therefore allowing as many of our young people as possible to become involved .
Although the funding of these programmes of EUR 520m is well below our original demand of EUR 980m which is necessary for new Member States after enlargement , there will be a possibility of increasing this figure , following extra demands on the budget by enlargement .
These programmes will certainly benefit our young people and give them invaluable opportunities to learn about themselves , about others and about Europe .
Not only is this crucial for their personal development , but in a fiercely competitive world it will vastly improve their chances on the job market .
Increasing our young people &apos;s skills has always been one of our priorities and we must continue to support this aim .
Our young people are Europe &apos;s future .
We must encourage them to learn about others and about the European Union , as well as developing their own values , ideas and skills .
It is important that they are able to participate in voluntary work abroad , school exchanges and learning languages .
Funding for these types of programmes are a fundamental step towards this objective of opening the eyes and minds of our young people and preparing them to be part of a flexible , skilled workforce .
Our society does not have enough confidence in young people .
In my political life I have always been struck by the fact that the future of young people and their concerns are not at the heart of public debate , and neither the political world nor the power of the media really tries to help young people .
That is especially true in Normandy , the region I represent , where too often youth is associated with deviance and delinquency , forgetting the vast majority of young people who work , dream , love and live , the bearers of all our hopes .
The European &apos; Youth &apos; initiative is a first step in that direction , and bears witness to a growing awareness of young people in the EU institutions .
But it is essential to maintain this effort over time if it is to bear the desired fruit , in the interests of young people and therefore of Europe .
So I am convinced that other initiatives , especially aid to youth associations , should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the European Union .
Graça Moura report ( A5-0099 / 2000 )
Gasòliba i Böhm ( ELDR ) .
( ES ) Mr President , we would like to express our satisfaction on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party at the approval of the Graça Moura report on the European Year of Languages 2001 .
We believe that it is a magnificent initiative on a European level to dedicate a special year to languages in Europe , to knowledge of them and to the recognition throughout the whole of the European Union of the importance of languages as a reservoir of cultural and historical wealth and an expression of the very identity of the societies which make up the Union .
We have supported this report but there are two aspects which we are not happy with .
I am referring to some amendments which we have presented , both on behalf of the Liberal Group as well as the group of MEPs headed by Mrs Ferrer , in order to incorporate in a clear and specific way the official languages which are recognised in the Member States so that they may participate directly and in an institutional sense in the development of the European Year of Languages .
This amendment has not been taken up , and we regret the line followed by the European Commission , with the participation of the Member States , because it leaves aside , at risk of marginalising it , a form of participation which is particularly important in this field .
I would like to remind you that this Parliament recognised Catalan as a European language and gave it a specific personality .
It is this language , together with others , which must be taken into account in the application and celebration of this European Year of Languages .
Mr President , I voted for the establishment of the European Year of Languages 2001 .
This is , without any doubt , a major , positive step , although , in my opinion , every year should be a year of languages .
It is of paramount importance for the European Union that the citizens of the 15 States learn to speak the languages of their fellow citizens of the European Union .
I would like to take this opportunity to call for language teaching for the elderly to receive just as much attention and funding as language teaching for young people , which receives an extensive amount of aid.In this respect , the elderly are all too often forgotten and they would love to visit the other States of the European Union .
Mr President , I would like to give an explanation of my negative vote on the report on the European Year of Languages .
Firstly , language occupies an important place in European civilisation and culture , irrespective of numerical considerations regarding the size of the population .
This statement is thoroughly valid for lesser-used languages .
Secondly , the target year for this decision is 2001 ;
European citizens could become proficient in other languages as is shown by the fact that all people who speak minority languages , without exception , have in common an excellent training in this field .
All of them are already bilingual .
It is completely wrong to exclude minority languages from this initiative .
It is regrettable that this House has not accepted the important services that lesser-used languages could contribute to the success of this initiative .
I am glad the European Parliament and the Council have agreed to make 2001 the European Year of Languages .
In a European Union of fifteen Member States , committed to enlargement , with eleven official languages and a multitude of regional languages , it is actually very important to make the citizens of the Union aware of the advantages of understanding and speaking other languages and of the many opportunities that exist for learning to do so .
Speaking a language other than one &apos; s mother tongue undoubtedly broadens the mind .
So , from primary school and kindergarten , children should be encouraged to start learning languages , as an instrument to raise awareness of cultural diversity .
Some European countries , especially the Scandinavian countries , already have very advanced policies in this field and the resulting advantages are evident .
This practice needs to be disseminated to the other Member States .
Of course , we must ensure that this knowledge is not confined only to the better off in society .
Boosting the learning of foreign languages will bring European citizens closer together by giving them the means to communicate , and thus get to know each other and forge the links to make the concept of European citizenship a reality .
Opening up to other cultures and finding out about the traditions of our European neighbours are essential ways of combating intolerance and racism engendered by fear of the unknown .
At the practical level , it needs to be made clear that the European Year of Languages is in fact a joint European Union / Council of Europe project .
To show that , it would be better for the two partners to use an identical logo and slogan .
The same concern for visibility and transparency leads me to support the creation of an interactive Internet site so that people can access useful information about the project .
I am in favour of people being multilingual , but I am sorry we are not trying to develop the teaching of Esperanto in parallel .
It is a language with European roots and easy to understand , but also rich and subtle .
As an auxiliary language , it can provide one means , amongst others , of facilitating communication between all European citizens .
I therefore regret that it is not mentioned in this proposal .
The undersigned members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left agree entirely with the point of view of both the Commission and the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport that language is a rather crucial component of human communication , whether it be the spoken or written language , sign language or body language .
There are people who prefer Esperanto as a form of communication across national borders .
There are also professional jargons , different dialects in one and the same country and minority languages which are now being recognised by democracies .
It is also important for posterity to carry out research into languages which are dying out .
In short , we believe that an understanding of the importance of language is invaluable and that the European Union ought to be acknowledging this beyond the mere one year of the present campaign .
We hope that this view of ours is also shared by the Council and by national parliaments both within and outside the Union .
The sums proposed by the Commission ( EUR 8 million ) and by the Committee ( EUR 10 million ) are too modest , in our opinion .
It ought to be possible to spend the proposed sums of money on other things , for which reason we are completely abstaining from voting .
- ( NL ) I am pleased with the report by Mr Graça Moura , the rapporteur , and I am grateful to him that my amendments have been adopted .
In the frame of this European Year , most of the amendments aim to establish closer cooperation with the Member States at all levels of policy , not only at national level but also at regional and even local policy level .
An essential requirement for this is that the Member States earmark sufficient funds to set up activities that can then be cofinanced by the European Union .
If not , the European Year of Languages is likely to remain a PR exercise , just a lot of hot air .
The second aim of my amendments was by means of the activities set up in the context of this European Year to pay special attention to socially vulnerable groups , migrants and semi-skilled and unskilled workers .
This is something very close to my heart : learning to have an active command of foreign languages should not become the umpteenth barrier to the integration of this target group , a privilege for the already privileged members of our society .
Foreign language learning is indeed the key to integration .
A third series of amendments that I have tabled concerns the availability of language courses and accessibility to them in the respective Member States .
It is an open secret that this situation differs greatly from one Member State to another .
Smaller Member States with a correspondingly small language area must ipso facto make much greater effort , whereas in the larger Member States and larger language areas respectively the economic incentive is not so great .
The Member States are therefore inherently asymmetrical in this regard .
I hope that the Council will endorse this initiative and that we shall be able to start the specific activities as soon as possible , because there is a lot to be done .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , giving Europeans the best training for the future , from their earliest youth , whatever their origin and level of education , above all means giving them the ability to speak languages other than their mother tongue .
Haute-Normandie has one of the youngest populations in France , but also one of the highest levels of youth unemployment .
Speaking another European language can clearly be a key to success for those young people .
Making 2001 European Year of Languages will make Europeans aware of the linguistic diversity of the European Union.It is an excellent decision and has my full support .
But I do not think we should only devote one year to this aim.Lasting commitment is needed .
Indeed , it is our duty to be ambitious and to demand that all our young people are able to speak another language fluently , offering them bilingual education whenever possible .
In this respect , IBIS ( Institut Bilingue Interuniversitaire de la Seine ) , which first saw the light of day in Haute-Normandie , is most exemplary .
I am convinced that other operations of a similar nature should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the European Union .
Dary report ( A5-0093 / 2000 )
Maes ( Verts / ALE ) .
( NL ) Mr President , we not only voted with enthusiasm for this report , but also for the amendments that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tabled .
We are sure that in our partner countries of the ACP , substantial investments are being made in order to be able to compete with regard to quality on the world market .
The problem , however , is the price .
Many of these countries are still battling with excessively high costs and I believe that a long transitional period , which I would insist on , is very important for these countries .
I think our ACP partners will also be pleased with the outcome of this vote .
- The British Labour members have a strong commitment to the producers in the Caribbean and wish to see an early settlement of the dispute within the WTO .
These are delicate negotiations and at this stage the UK does not rule out an eventual tariff only system .
This is the context in which we have supported the Dary report while being against Amendments Nos 6 and 7 .
- ( NL ) It is clear from the debates once again that there is still considerable disagreement in the Union about the length of the transitional period , the level of the quotas and the system for granting licences .
The vote on the Dary report has demonstrated once again that the European Parliament does not respect the internationally agreed trading rules .
It is unacceptable that in the Dary report again a transitional period of ten years is proposed , without putting a definitive ruling first .
Taking account of the internationally agreed trading rules within the WTO , the GATT Agreement and the internal market strategy of the European Union , we should be arguing in favour of introducing a tariff only system as quickly as possible .
We could possibly agree provisionally on a tariff quota ruling that is WTO compliant , but on condition that a date is specified on which the tariff only system will be introduced .
Belgium has always argued in favour of the immediate adaptation of the banana regime to comply with the WTO , but with a concession to the ACP countries .
Preference should indeed be given to a tariff only system because this option respects the trading flows best and is most clearly WTO compliant .
The vote today is a sham because the real decisions have been taken in secret deals between the great capitalist groups of the United States and the European Union.Their banana war is just one aspect and , like banana production , just one factor in a complex of conflicts of interest .
This war , which is presented as a conflict between producer countries , Latin American and dollar area countries against Lomé Convention countries and European overseas dependent territories , is actually a war between capitalist groups .
Three large American capitalist groups , including Chiquita , the new name for the notorious United Fruit , dominate the dollar banana and are supported by the American Government .
Behind the producer countries the European Union is claiming to protect , however , there are some large families of wealthy French-Creoles and , indeed , powerful English and French groups .
Our position is this : while we do not want to give the mighty dollar banana sharks any awards , neither do we have any intention of providing backing through our votes to the smaller sharks protected by the European Union .
However , it is essential to take measures to protect the small producers who work their own plantations without exploiting anyone , and for them to be guaranteed a decent minimum income , regardless of market fluctuations .
We demand protection for agricultural labourers , who should not be the victims of the commercial war raging on the world market .
If a guarantee fund is created , it must underwrite the wages of these workers and the incomes of small producers , and not allow banana magnates to increase their wealth just to invest it in other , more profitable , sectors .
- ( FR ) This report gives us the opportunity to welcome the European Parliament &apos; s becoming aware of the need to defend the banana producers of , on the one hand , the ACP countries ( to whom we have made commitments in the course of renewing the Lomé Convention ) and , on the other hand , the outermost countries of the Community .
Although the WTO &apos; s dispute settlement body condemned certain key elements in the competitivity of ACP operators , the validity of the principle of tariff quotas has not been challenged in any way .
The fact is that we are , as is often the case , witnessing the overzealousness of the Commission which , in the context of the negotiations initiated within the WTO , has gone too far .
In attempting to reconcile the contradictory interests of all parties , in the end it has not been able , or has not wished , to achieve this .
It therefore seems curious , to say the least , to note the paradox of acknowledging that operators are all in favour of a tariff quota system , while adopting the solution of a single rate system !
We therefore congratulate Mr Dary and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are attempting to restore a little order to the Commission proposal which we find simply unacceptable as it stands , because it is selling off Community interests for the benefit of American multinationals whose manufacturing standards are obviously not comparable with EU standards .
While it may , admittedly , be quite laudable to seek to obtain the most advantageous prices for consumers , we must still be able to compare like with like , particularly in terms of manufacturing conditions ( social legislation , child protection ) .
We must therefore ensure that we do not tend towards harmonising these social conditions of manufacturing to the lowest common denominator , and , instead , let us pursue , as a priority , the objective of better product quality , without GMOs or pesticides or anything else.Developing better quality products will cause a consequent increase in demand , and thus in the volume of production , with a concomitant reduction in prices !
After years of difficulty due to the economic crisis in industrialised countries and the decline in the economies of Eastern Europe , the Commission &apos; s solution would be likely to cause the untimely disappearance of these producing countries whose economies would not , for want of time , be able to restructure and diversify production .
It is clear today that , without actively seeking confrontation , the EU must champion its own point of view , a position which is all the more tenable as present and future European consumers represent a major proportion of the banana market .
We are therefore satisfied with Mr Dary &apos; s report , even if we feel it does not go far enough , particularly in terms of the ACP tariff system , the transition period extended beyond ten years , and the definition of a new system for the allocation of import licences , or additional European aid .
- ( SV ) The EU &apos; s system for importing bananas - which the WTO panel declared to be discriminatory on 7 April 1999 - must be reformed .
There is justification for showing consideration for banana producers in the ACP States and in the extremely peripheral areas of the Union , but there is no reason for special treatment in the field of trade .
Import duties and production subsidies are incompatible with our liberal values .
In our view , it is only through a system of free trade that long-term , sustainable , global economic development can be created .
For that reason , the Commission &apos; s proposal for a rapid transition to a system with fixed uniform rates of duty is a step in the right direction .
Lagendijk report ( A5-0069 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
( IT ) Mr President , it was with great pleasure that I voted for this measure on the communication from the Commission on the stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe .
This is one of the measures adopted in this Chamber which I have most appreciated , for I am sure we all remember the serious problems which arose in this area just over a year ago during the NATO military intervention .
I feel that the only way to prevent wars is precisely to be closely aware of the tangible problems of other peoples .
In all probability , it is only this initiative and those which will be approved and supported by the European Parliament which will truly succeed in preventing disasters in this region and any other regions that find themselves in a similar situation .
In this communication from the Commission , the European Union sets out its claim to impose itself as protector on the countries of South East Europe .
But throughout the century which has just ended , that region of Europe has known nothing but suffering because of that claim , whether made by rival European powers or by a Western Europe which likes to think it is united .
While it is easy for the rapporteur to denounce nationalism and local chauvinism , which are indeed intolerable , who can forget that the great European powers have always played on these nationalisms , setting them against each other according to their interests as great powers ?
The economic and political rivalries between European powers have led to two world wars : the first started in that region and the second was particularly destructive there .
As to the newly united Europe , it has principally distinguished itself first by contributing to the carve-up of former Yugoslavia , and then by bombing Serbia and Kosovo .
As the entire current situation illustrates , that war has further aggravated the situation in the region , both in material terms and in terms of relations between communities .
Under the circumstances , entrusting the stability of this region to the European powers is the same as having the wolf look after the sheep .
Our vote against this report expresses our opposition to the past and present policies of the European powers .
I am delighted to welcome this report calling for the European Union to play a leading role in the context of the stability and association pact for the countries of South-Eastern Europe .
People are always saying that South-Eastern Europe is the European Union &apos; s crisis-riven back yard .
The political context in this region is extremely sensitive and came to a climax in the Kosovo conflict .
That conflict demonstrated the potential political effects of instability on the neighbouring States , threatening to destabilise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM ) , Albania and Montenegro .
Other countries in the region like Bulgaria and Romania have also suffered serious economic repercussions .
It is easy to see that the European Union has every interest in the stabilisation of the region and that interest will grow with future enlargement .
The European Union was traumatised by its powerlessness in the face of the process of violent disintegration at work in the Balkans .
It was incapable of doing anything likely to stop that disintegration because it lacked a common political will for action , but it also lacked a political approach and appropriate instruments which would have allowed it to manage the crisis effectively at the international level .
It can be said that the Balkan crisis was a turning point which had the effect of stamping a decisive orientation on European defence and security policy .
The decisions of the European Councils of Cologne and Helsinki on creating military and civilian capabilities for independent European Union crisis management are proof of that .
The outcome of the Cologne Council was the establishment of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe on 10 June 1999 , a pact involving not only the Member States of the European Union and , of course , the countries of the region , but also the United States and Russia .
The pact is part of the global stabilisation approach the European Union has been developing since 1996 .
The stabilisation and association agreements to be signed by Bosnia-Herzegovina , Croatia , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania are the keystone of that approach .
Negotiations are currently taking place with Macedonia .
Croatia , where positive political changes have recently occurred , should be involved in the near future .
These agreements constitute an entirely new contractual framework for the countries of the region ; they draw great inspiration from the institutional arrangements and conditions attached to the European agreements linking the European Union with the CEECs .
These agreements are individually tailored to take account of the specific situation in each country .
They hold out the prospect of long-term integration into the European Union on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam and in compliance with the Copenhagen criteria .
Above all , they give the countries of this crisis-riven region an important political signal and a definite incentive .
These agreements also encourage stronger regional cooperation , which seems to me indispensable to the creation of an axis of stability in the region .
García-Margallo y Marfíl report ( A5-0059 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
( IT ) Mr President , I also voted for the measure on the Commission communication on implementing the framework for financial markets : Action Plan , because it is clearly important for the European Parliament , the Commission , the Union and the Council to make progress in terms of competition , using networks and electronic money , which are the latest forms of economic activity .
I would have been happier with my decision to vote for the measure if it had included the intention to present every pensioner with a computer when he draws out his first pension payment.The elderly need to familiarise themselves with new commerce techniques as well as young people .
.
( PT ) This report comments favourably on the Commission &apos; s proposal for an action plan on financial markets , the objective of which is to liberalise capital markets .
It is also in line with the Lisbon Summit , which declared that this and other liberalisation programmes should be speeded up .
But the truth is that this process increases financial instability and encourages concentration of capital markets and financial institutions , and for this reason we are opposed both to the position adopted by the Commission and to the rapporteur &apos; s position .
However , with a view to introducing specific measures to combat the volatility of capital markets and to control capital movements in the EU , especially those of a speculative nature , and also with a view to minimising the risk of financial crises , we attempted , by means of an amendment to this effect , to persuade the Commission to include in its action plan corresponding concrete measures.These included , in particular , the presentation of a report on the introduction of a tax on capital movements , especially speculative movements .
We regret that our amendment was not approved .
The resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is certainly much better than the original version , and I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr García-Margallo y Marfil .
However , I have not been able to vote for it because it still contains inconsistencies after the plenary vote .
Thus , as regards the idea of the creation of a commission for stock exchange operations , I recommend a green paper on the establishment or gradual creation of such a commission , preceded by a feasibility study .
Moreover , the subsidiarity principle requires that , at a time of remarkable boom in the craze for cross-border investments in securities , we bear in mind that the interests of the issuing companies and investors will be better served by proximity of supervision and monitoring of international investments , with more efficient channels for cooperation between the monitoring authorities .
Supervision of the securities markets can be carried out better by people close to the markets and with in-depth knowledge of them .
In this context , comparison with the commission in place in the United States , the SEC , is particularly inappropriate , because the SEC is the corollary of a financial system resulting largely from a segmentation of the profession between commercial banks and investment banks , and in Europe we have chosen the universal bank model , which has strengthened the role of the banks in the European financial system .
It would be equally aberrant to include the stock exchange listing rules in the remit of such a commission , when at most it should ensure respect for them .
The establishment of a pan-European equity listing would also be aberrant .
Harmonised yet competitive listings guarantee a diversity of investment products .
A pan-European listing would make it impossible for national stock exchanges to concentrate on niche markets and would restrict opportunities for specialisation which may emerge from a competitive situation , even though it is convergent .
Instead of focusing on the listings - already largely harmonised anyway - to the detriment of diversity , we should emphasise rapprochement or even harmonisation of existing dealing systems and environments should be emphasised .
On prudential supervision , I made a direct appeal to the Commission and the Council yesterday not to cling to the crazy idea of entrusting supervision of all the credit establishments in the fifteen Member States to the European Central Bank .
Governments control banking activities , hence the need for financial sector supervision by government authorities , not the European Central Bank .
I have not voted for paragraph 26 which is mostly incomprehensible in French anyway .
Kuckelhorn report ( A5-0053 / 2000 )
Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
( IT ) Mr President , considering that we are discussing supplementary pensions , the representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party could not let the occasion pass without explaining why he voted for this measure .
I am convinced that the future of pensioners can only lie in supplementary pensions.These pensions should , however , be optional and replace compulsory State pensions , which are a veritable sieve and lose water from all sides .
When we cook spaghetti , which is a delicious Italian national dish , we use a colander , a container full of holes which drains the water off the spaghetti .
Well , instead of a colander , we could use the national State schemes , which , I am afraid , also lose water from all sides , except that , instead of water , it is the hard-earned money of all the working citizens which drains away .
For this reason , we must replace the national State pension schemes with private supplementary and alternative pension schemes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Amendment No 39 by mistake .
In fact I reject it for the following reasons : this amendment is based on the assumption that neither the Commission report nor the European Parliament &apos; s Kuckelkorn report give any impetus towards structural reforms in the Member States of the European Union as regards reforming retirement pensions .
The opposite is true of course .
Right now there is a considerable need for reform in Member States &apos; retirement pension systems .
I therefore believe that any impetus given by the European Union and by the European Parliament will assist debate in the Member States , where we still have more questions than answers .
.
( PT ) We voted against this report because we consider that in content it differs little from the Commission &apos; s proposal , which aims to put social security totally in the hands of the financial markets , thus weakening or even replacing state pension schemes by stock market speculation.This makes it quite clear what the &quot; modernisation of social protection &quot; agreed at the Lisbon Summit is meant to be .
As we stated in the amendments we tabled , creating a single market for supplementary pension funds is not an adequate response to future demographic problems.What we need are expansionist economic policies which help to create permanent jobs , thus expanding the pool of contributors to the state pension fund .
The state social security system , which is financed on a solid footing independent of commercial interests and financial profitability , and which is based on a spirit of solidarity between generations , is in a position to guarantee the right to a dignified retirement and to security in old age for workers who have paid contributions to state pension schemes .
I spoke yesterday on the Kuckelhorn report as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights .
The committee expressed an opinion on the outcome of the consultation on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market , just as it did on the Green Paper itself .
We believe this very broad consultation should rapidly conclude with a proposal for a framework directive to ensure the development of a genuine single market in supplementary pension funds , under the second and third pillars.The first pillar , covering biometric risks , must still continue to be the cornerstone of social protection in the European Union .
The targeted directive we are seeking for the second pillar of supplementary pensions should , in particular , define the context for eliminating obstacles to free choice of pension fund , free movement of persons , free provision of services and double taxation .
As regards taxation , the only acceptable solution is one based on the principle that contributions should be tax deductible , at least up to a certain ceiling , and that supplementary pensions paid out should be taxable in accordance with the income tax legislation applying in the countries of residence .
As regards the controversial question of whether supplementary pension systems should cover biometric risks , I want to point out that , from the fiscal point of view , pension funds which do not cover these risks cannot be discriminated against as compared with those which do cover them , it being understood that the need to cover these risks depends on the extent of the first pillar in the various countries .
Subsidiarity and free choice require this .
Prudential rules must not be disproportionate to ensuring that the funds are secure .
They must be differentiated according to whether a scheme is internal or external to the enterprise .
They must allow managers to determine the best investment strategy .
In the absence of agreement on certain essential points , I am unable to vote for the general framework .
I regret this all the more as almost all the relevant conclusions from the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and my recommendations are included in the motion for a resolution , in particular those considering that
as regards supplementary pensions too , the preservation of acquired rights is essential when a spouse interrupts or abandons his or her work in order to devote himself or herself to his or her family or look after close relatives who are in need of assistance ;
for the purpose of calculating pensions , certain periods devoted to the upbringing of children or care of family members ought to be taken into account ;
it is desirable to provide for the possibility of continued voluntary or optional insurance to preserve and improve pension rights and guarantee a right to payment of the capital under certain conditions .
We should obviously take advantage of this opportunity to ask the Member States to implement more consistently the principle of equal pay for equal work , because wage discrimination against women has repercussions on women &apos; s pension levels .
Any legal or contractual provisions infringing the principle of equality of treatment of men and women should be invalid .
Finally , I want to reiterate my long-standing demand - disregarded by the Commission for many years - for revision of the existing directives on equality of treatment of women and men in terms of social security , in the same way as it applies in legal and professional systems .
And let us not forget assisting spouses , those millions of invisible workers , the large majority women , on whose behalf this Parliament has demanded an upgrading of the half-hearted 1986 directive to give assisting spouses proper status and compulsory membership of social security schemes , especially pension schemes .
On 28 March President Prodi and seven of his colleagues met with members of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights , the European Women &apos; s Lobby and the Equal Opportunities Consultative Committee.I hope he and the committee responsible will now stop ignoring those demands of the European Parliament I have just mentioned .
Palacio Vallelersundi report ( A5-0098 / 2000 )
Mr President , I also voted for the Communication : &quot; The strategy for Europe &apos; s internal market &quot; , despite the fact that the text did not include the opinion drafted by Mr Medina Ortega on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , page 20 of which states that from the point of view of social security , the ideal of supplementary pensions requires the creation of a genuine European social security system - and I repeat , European social security system - to replace the current approach , which is based on the harmonisation of national systems .
I am not , therefore , alone in hoping that , tomorrow , the 15 governments will at last decide to take social security and pensions in hand at European level , for this is the only way to prevent the current breakdown of the systems .
.
( EL ) According to its communication , the Commission intends over the next five years to continue the same internal market strategy , but to apply it more strictly and extend it to new areas .
Not only does the European Parliament report support this approach , it also calls for the relevant measures to be speeded up .
The starting point for the proposed objectives are what are typically referred to as the &apos; enormous benefits &apos; of the internal market .
However , no explanation is given as to who will benefit from , and who will suffer under , this procedure .
Without doubt , the only outcome of all the measures to implement the principles of free establishment and free provision of services , the measures to liberalise the markets , the measures to promote the free movement of goods and the numerous concomitant laws is to strengthen the huge multinationals whose potential to extend and mobilise on new markets at greatly reduced costs has been facilitated and which have benefited from deregulation measures.These multinationals have seen their profits increase and their position consolidated .
Unfortunately , the same does not apply to small- or medium-sized businesses in small Member States , where much stiffer competition has resulted in an increase in the number of bankruptcies , shrinking business and job cuts .
The problem for these companies is not , of course , that they are &apos; hampered in exploiting the opportunities afforded by the internal market &apos; ; their problem is precisely the measures used to implement the internal market , the principles which constitute the EU &apos;s competition legislation and the reduction in demand in the middle and lower classes as the result of anti-grass roots austerity policies .
And , of course , the solution does not lie in venture capital and the financial markets , which increase the risks for most small businesses , due to their limited resources , but in a different economic development policy which supports productive investment , increases demand and makes it easier for small businesses to trade .
The report calls for new , improved arrangements for companies by &apos; simplifying the legal , administrative and fiscal environment &apos; and for &apos; laws ... which do not involve costs and other burdens for businesses which would otherwise lose their competitive advantage over foreign competitors &apos; .
In other words , even less accountable capital transactions and even fewer legislative specifications .
At the same time , there is not a word about workers &apos; rights , about the fact that fewer obstacles mean less protection under labour legislation and less accountability during mass redundancies , mergers and transfers .
It is not by chance that neither the individual Commission proposals nor the European Council guidelines make any reference to the need to limit these phenomena , control speculative movements of capital and impose a tax and other measures on capital .
The report calls for greater liberalisation of sectors such as the pharmaceutical market and a reduction in the tax burden on employment , thereby proving that the measures being taken are paving the way for greater liberalisation of and less accountable capital transactions and profits with exceptionally dangerous consequences for the entire social protection system .
The report under discussion is fully in line with the anti-grass roots economic and social policy exercised within the framework of the single internal market and EMU and we shall , of course , be voting against it .
The sub-text of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi &apos; s report is recognition of the deadlock between national governments , which fail to transpose Community law when it does not serve their interests , and companies , normally the principal beneficiaries of the single market , which have to be convinced of the benefits through information campaigns and &apos; incentives &apos; .
In the light of the success of earlier campaigns on the euro , the results of these are still to be established .
This is another illustration of the &apos; soviet-style &apos; procedures of the Community institutions which are now trying to invent the new consumer and the new businessman , after the new citizen of the Ludford report .
So while the rapporteur supports companies , especially when faced with the difficulties SMEs encounter because of &apos; administrative obstacles &apos; and complexities , I have considerable reservations about certain provisions in the final text .
The report underlines the vital importance of making infringement procedures faster and more efficient and &apos; welcomes the proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference &apos; along those lines.Because Community centralisation is failing to demonstrate its validity and its contribution , we are now forced to insist on repressive procedures , where cooperation would have made it possible to draw up flexible rules more easily acceptable to those involved .
Then , the Commission should , and I quote , &apos; pay special attention to creating internal-market mindedness &apos; in national governments , &apos; while monitoring national implementing measures &apos; .
When we know the political context surrounding officials in Community institutions , this desire to brainwash officials in our governments alarms me .
Finally , the report regrets that the advantage to businesses of treating the whole of the EU as a single market rather than as a collection of national markets is not always apparent to them.To remedy this lack of awareness which is additional to administrative obstacles and consumer behaviour , the report envisages &apos; mass information campaigns similar to those conducted in the case of the euro and incentives to encourage the private sector not to treat partners from other Member States unfavourably &apos; .
These points do not seem to undermine the confidence of this House in the chosen Community construction model.People are going to be made happy , whether they like it or not .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
COM in milk
The next item is the report ( A5-0081 / 2000 ) by Mr Pesälä , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products ( COM ( 1999 ) 631 - C5-0339 / 1999 - 1999 / 0254 ( CNS ) ) .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is indeed a matter of an amendment to a Regulation by means of which competence would be transferred from the Council to the Commission .
With this amendment to the Regulation , the Commission would be empowered to amend the list of goods not covered by Annex 1 .
The Commission already has this power in the area of agricultural produce , such as grain , sugar , rice and eggs .
It would be logical if this power were extended to cover milk products .
This would be the case as a result of the amendment .
When we consider that funds set aside for aiding exports will dwindle in a couple of years from EUR 587 million to EUR 415 million , as a result of WTO agreements , it would be a good thing if the Commission had the power to examine the list of goods .
There are many goods for export that also contain substantial amounts of non-milk products , such as yoghurt containing sugar and fruit , and yet dairy products attract export subsidies .
This being the case , the question here is very much one of logic , allowing us to proceed in the same way as with grain , sugar , rice and eggs .
It is also very much a question of budgetary discipline , of being able to observe budgetary discipline consistently in the years to come , as appropriations for exports grow scarcer .
There has been some discussion that the transfer of power from the Council to the Commission might not be such a good thing .
My own view on this , and on such situations as this , is that it is what we call a zero-sum game .
We must be logical and adopt the right use of power and the right course to do our job as well and as consistently as possible .
This has nothing whatsoever to do with shifting the balance of interinstitutional power .
I think it is rooted in common sense , and a very far-reaching sense of consistency .
In my opinion , in the future , when prices and situations change rapidly in the world markets , this is the way we should be able to progress with regard to practical matters and react quickly .
I believe the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also unanimous on this .
This amendment to the Regulation must be made .
It will be a very good and positive move for everyone , and agricultural and dairy producers in particular .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start by very sincerely thanking Mr Pesälä for his statement , but I must say straight away that the thrust of my comments is somewhat different .
We have a slogan in German which says &apos; Milk cheers up tired chaps &apos; .
But you can also just say &apos; Milk cheers you up &apos; , because we now have some women in key positions in the Commission and that is why I would like to put on record my view that the Commission is now cheerfully planning to abolish export refunds for milk products too .
The Commission is empowered to delete goods eligible for export refunds under the COMs for cereals , sugar , rice and eggs , for example .
In the case of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty the list has been amended in this way .
My question is this : is the Commission now seeking carte blanche for other products ?
I know that the Member States have taken widely differing views of this , not least in Council meetings .
Is this really what is intended for the entire milk sector ?
I would be grateful if you could give me a couple of answers in a moment , when we consider whether this really is efficient .
The Commission text indicates that additional administrative options are to be created , so as to facilitate more precise selection of those goods for which export refunds are to be granted .
Would the Commission not agree that in this context the expression &apos; efficient use &apos; is rather euphemistic ?
What does &apos; efficient &apos; mean in plain language ?
In this case , &quot; efficient &quot; quite simply means abolishing export refunds for milk products .
In practice it means that , for example , no export refunds will be granted for the milk part of fruit yoghurt .
So I would like to ask if there is not a danger that without the milk export refund component export refunds for yoghurt will be reduced .
Do you have real calculations and reliable figures for this ? What will the situation be then ?
The rapporteur , Mr Pesälä , has , of course , already pointed out that this will also hit other products .
There are also other export products , such as cakes and pastries , which contain milk components .
So it sounds rather crazy to me if , on the one hand , we say that we must reduce costs while , on the other , it is possible , because more milk will remain on the market , that additional costs will have to be met for storage and so on .
As I see it , excess production in the milk sector is likely to get worse rather than improve , and this gradual increase in minimum market access and the simultaneous reduction in the maximum export refund are rather contradictory .
I am sure that you will be able to explain this in your statement in a moment .
I believe that in terms of market policy there is no urgent need for this , and I can therefore see no reason why I should happily vote for this procedure or why it should be in the interests of the people I represent .
I think I might find it rather difficult to explain to the farmers at home .
So I would like to ask once more - is the abolition of these export refunds really unavoidable ?
Of course we agreed at the Berlin Summit that savings would have to be made , but surely in the right place .
I am sure that you will be able to give us some answers in a moment .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to thank you very sincerely , Mr Pesälä , for your report .
So what is this all about ?
The proposal is to transfer to the Commission the power to amend the list of processed products containing milk products which are eligible for refunds .
As the rapporteur has already explained , the Commission already has this power for cereals , sugar , rice and eggs .
Planned total expenditure for export refunds for goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty have been reduced from EUR 610 million in budget year 1999 to EUR 551 million in budget year 2000 .
Why ?
This year , for the last time , we can exceed the WTO upper limit of EUR 475 million by the amounts not used in 1999 .
In the next GATT year , total permissible expenditure will be limited to EUR 415 million by the WTO system , and it will no longer be possible to carry amounts forward .
Let us compare : last year we had EUR 610 million , and next year will only be able to spend EUR 415 million .
We believe that it would have been unwise to make this enormous change from 600 to 400 in one go .
So we have introduced an interim stage this year .
Our WTO commitments and budgetary discipline mean that we have to adopt a selective approach .
That means that we can no longer grant export refunds for products where this is not essential to maintain their competitiveness.And that , Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert , is exactly what you were asking about .
We want to be in a position to adjust the list in accordance with destinations and sales opportunities , so that in future we can use the maximum permissible amount of budget appropriations to export a maximum volume of milk products .
You gave yoghurt as an example , and it is a good one , as it demonstrates how illogical a system can be .
At present , the situation is that if any sweeteners or other additives are added to a yoghurt , it is not covered by Annex I to the Treaty .
If it is a pure natural yoghurt , that is made from milk and nothing else , then it is a milk product and it is not classified as a good not covered by Annex I to the Treaty .
So we have not been paying export refunds any more for natural yoghurt for years , but we still have to grant them for flavoured yoghurts .
Is that logical ?
Surely you can see that .
We really are not in the business of putting the thumbscrews on agriculture ; this is about being able to react appropriately to short-term market requirements .
So this proposal will , in future , make it possible for the Commission to adapt the list of goods eligible for export refunds swiftly , but the Member States will be involved as it will come under the management committee procedure .
In conclusion , I would like to say that I find it discriminatory if milk only cheers up tired chaps .
Why not &apos; weary women &apos; as well ?
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
COM in milk
The next item is the report ( A5-0074 / 2000 ) by Mr Maat , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products ( COM ( 1999 ) 608 - C5-0047 / 2000 - 1999 / 0246 ( CNS ) ) .
Mr President , during the two months I have been working on the report , I have discovered that feelings run high on the subject of school milk in Europe .
There have been many responses from schools throughout the European Union and also from school children .
I found that remarkable in itself .
There has also been much discussion because the Commission says let us go over to joint financing , which means reducing the European contribution .
Many schools reacted particularly to this point and I have also noticed among my supporters that people wondered whether things would turn out all right for school milk , whether it would keep going as an instrument ?
In that regard I must say that I was very fortunate as a new Member of Parliament that , in dealing with the budget for 2001 , Parliament in any case adopted my proposal to increase the school milk budget from EUR 53 to 83 million .
The proposal now before us in the report that was unanimously accepted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - I would stress &apos; unanimously &apos; - and it was particularly gratifying that all parties in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development support the report - boils down to the fact that more money is needed , EUR 96 million in fact .
That does not come entirely within the budget , but the reality is such that , in view of the change in the dairy market , this small difference could also perhaps be found in the dairy budget .
It is also for this reason that I would urge Parliament most strongly to support the report on school milk , because there is every reason to do so .
It is remarkable how casual we in Europe sometimes are about food .
It is always there and in itself is no problem .
But it is clear that school milk has an added value for the dietary pattern of children and contributes to a better diet , particularly in urban areas .
This has been borne out by studies .
The European Commission has also commissioned a study .
I did find it to be rather limited , on the basis of a desk study , but in view of the considerable interest in Europe there is every reason to continue the regulation .
There is extra money for education in the field of the Internet , the electronic superhighway and there is more attention paid to the environment and much attention to safe living and to social conditions and within this we should not neglect a sound policy on the proper use of food and undoubtedly on milk as well .
For these reasons , and to see whether this regulation could be brought more up to date , I am pleased that the report has also been accepted in this sense in the Committee and I hope it will also be in Parliament .
There is an expansion in the number of products that can be used in the school milk regulation .
I am thinking of drinking yoghurt , low-fat cheese , skimmed milk and in this regard valuable amendments have been tabled by my own Group , and also by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , among others by Mr Pesl for Scandinavia .
Many specific proposals have been made and that means that in this way we can adapt the school milk regulation in a better way and integrate it better into the current dietary pattern .
That in itself makes for a stronger case .
Anyone who thinks that the school milk regulation will rescue the dietary pattern is wrong .
You must also be realistic .
If this report is accepted by this House , every year about EUR 12 will be spent per child on subsidies for school milk and that is peanuts in my view .
This can easily be justified socially within the budget and in respect of a sound nutritional policy .
Mr President , on the basis of the information provided I shall wholeheartedly recommend this report .
I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their unanimous support , that bodes well for the vote in this House .
I should also like to thank the Commission for its willingness to provide the necessary information and also for preparing the report .
I hope it will lead to a constructive position with regard to the implementation of this report .
I understand that in any case the Council of Ministers will meet next Monday .
It would therefore be an appropriate moment if Parliament were to approve this report and the school milk regulation .
Mr President , at the request of Mr Cunha I am presenting our statement on this debate on the school milk scheme .
For more than 20 years , the European Union has been financing the free distribution of milk in primary and secondary schools .
In recent years this action has amounted to an average annual expenditure of some EUR 90 million for more than 300 million litres of milk , benefiting around 10 million children and young people , or nearly 20 % of eligible schoolchildren .
There are two main reasons justifying this measure and why it should continue .
The first is its social impact , as it ensures a minimum balanced diet for many children and young people who otherwise would not have access to one .
The main beneficiaries are children and young people from disadvantaged social classes and poorer districts in both rural and urban areas .
The second reason is that , as there is a structural surplus in the market for milk products , this measure also represents an incentive to dispose of milk in a far more useful and constructive way than by distributing it , denaturing it or exporting it to third countries at even greater cost .
It is a pity that the European Union does not have more actions of this kind for other products , instead of dumping them on international markets by means of subsidies which are sometimes twice their price on those markets , which makes it difficult to understand the alleged objective of budgetary savings .
The United States , which is famous for having a more individualist outlook with less solidarity , spends nearly 9 000 million dollars a year on distributing foods to schoolchildren , i.e. 100 times more than the European Union .
And the European Union is now proposing to move away from 100 % financing and is proposing 50 % cofinancing , which will especially penalise less wealthy countries like Portugal .
As a Portuguese national , I would be shocked if a measure of this kind were to be approved while my own country held the presidency of the European Union .
Mr President , Mr Maat has committed himself most impressively to the issue of school milk .
That is a good thing .
I myself am a great supporter of school milk .
In fact , I think that not only children but adults too should drink more milk .
I regret therefore that there is no fresh milk available at the Parliament building in Brussels .
I do hope that Mr Maat &apos; s next battle will concentrate on making fresh milk available in Brussels .
Having said that , I do not support Mr Maat &apos; s proposals .
In the evaluation report on the school milk regulation that the Commission itself quotes , it says that if you only take account of the explicitly stated objectives of the regulation particularly to maintain and increase the consumption of dairy products and promote the sale of surpluses , the positive effects are marginal .
Nevertheless , on 10 December , the Commission decided not to withdraw the measures but to halve the subsidy .
I have asked the Commission a number of questions in this regard .
I asked Commissioner Fischler to what extent this measure corresponded with the subsidiarity principle .
I believe that this measure could be implemented perfectly well by the national parliaments and that national MPs would be quite able to do so .
I am also not convinced about the scientific basis as far as certain aspects of public health are concerned .
Moreover , when dealing with public health , the Commission must make a proposal on the basis of the chapter on &quot; Public Health &quot; in the Treaty .
Nor is it clear to me in the school milk regulation how much will be spent on administration costs .
It is such a small proportion of the overall milk production that I feel that this weighs particularly heavily on the European Commission budget .
I am also not sure what the financial consequences will be after enlargement .
I am not an opponent of school milk as such but I do object to the way we are going about it .
I believe that the Commission must confine itself to the core tasks and leave other matters to the Member States .
I support the Commission proposal but not the proposals of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Maat for a good report and good cooperation , namely in his raising the issue of public health .
Until now the basis for pricing has favoured fattier products .
There was strong unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the need to change the basis for pricing so that less fatty products might benefit more from this aid .
It has been an excellent signal from the EU to the heart of the people for decades now , and we have been able to get it across via children , school pupils , schools and homes .
In that respect it has to continue , and , as Mr Maat said , be brought up to date and this issue , which is in the common good , should be promoted .
Amendments Nos 9 and 10 specifically move the proposal towards a direction where less fatty products would be treated along the same lines as fattier products .
Mr President , I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in the debate and I congratulate the rapporteur for his work .
One clear result , of course , of the proposal before us to curtail or remove this subsidy on school milk will be decreased availability of milk and a drop in the consumption of milk in schools .
I ask you sincerely : is that what you want to see happening ?
The nutritional aspect is surely the central element here and the continuation of the consumption of milk by schoolchildren is what we should be working towards .
The proposals before us definitely militate against that .
Can I suggest to you what might happen as a result .
There are two possibilities .
Children will switch to consuming non-nutritional products or , God forbid , we will move closer towards a situation where children will have to pay for milk consumed , thus discriminating against poor children from deprived communities .
We all acknowledge the aim here .
It is to cut milk subsidies .
But to use schoolchildren as the means towards that end is a sinister way to go about it , especially in a world that is becoming far more health-conscious by the day .
This is the age of non-GM food and organic products , and the proposals before us represent a major step backwards .
Let us be clear .
Several Member States will not operate this scheme at all if the present subsidy is withdrawn or decreased .
That is the reality of the situation .
This would be a catastrophe , not only for the health of schoolchildren - our future citizens - but to the viability of communities also .
I come from a part of Wales , where GDP per head of the population is less than 75 % of the European Union average , in other words , an Objective 1 area .
I am not proud of that .
It is an indication of our deprived status .
Cutting the subsidy , however , would make my community even poorer , a community whose farmers have lost 80 % of their income in 2 ½ years .
This is not the European Union that I thought my nation had joined .
We were looking to a Europe of cohesion that seeks to bolster its deprived communities and help its poorest citizens .
There is also the misconception that Member States will somehow foot this bill and make up the deficit on the basis that it is their responsibility to deal with health and social policy .
Can I tell you that my Member State , the UK , is already prevaricating on the provision of additional money for Wales and for Scotland to match European funds , a point that I and my colleagues have already highlighted previously in this Chamber .
This is not unique to my nation .
Sadly , it affects other nations as well .
Farmers then are told to diversify , to become multifunctional .
These are the buzzwords now in the European Union .
Yet they have already diversified .
They have already become as multifunctional as humanly possible .
It is time we rewarded them , particularly in the peripheral and deprived communities of the European Union .
Cutting this subsidy would destroy an industry already on its knees .
We need to give a window of opportunity to these people and provide them with the assistance to sustain themselves as they undoubtedly face the most difficult period economically they have ever faced .
It is clear to me that the proposals before us are not merely a means to curtail the subsidy , but rather , in the event of a lack of participation by Member States in the wake of the subsidy cut , to terminate it entirely .
This continued erosion of the milk industry is , I am afraid , part of a general trend that we are witnessing throughout the agricultural industry .
Without people farming in our villages and communities , there will be no rural communities ; nobody left to service the needs of those of us that sometimes visit rural areas for recreation .
The process of amalgamating farms and the buying-up of farm units by consortia pushing up prices unrealistically is already well advanced in my nation of Wales and is becoming the sad pattern in other regions and nations as well .
I believe we should call a halt to this general erosion of our rural communities .
At the present moment in time , that requirement transcends the need to cut milk subsidies .
Defending communities is far , far more important .
We must keep our milk farmers farming and the communities where they earn their living as viable entities .
The Agricultural Committee deserve every support in this regard .
Mr Maat has done well in a very difficult situation and I wish him every success .
Mr President , Mr Maat &apos; s report quite properly defends the right of millions of European children to receive subsidised milk in school .
The Commission is proposing to reduce the level of Community aid , by amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products .
The choice of cofinancing involves the risk that certain Member States might be reticent about supporting the project , mainly because of financial constraints , and the effect would be to reduce the amount of the available budgetary appropriation and thus establish discrimination between European schoolchildren .
Milk distribution in schools contributes to the maintenance of consumption of milk products , and those same milk products are vital to healthy nutrition for children , so that they can grow up healthy .
Subsidising milk means teaching children balanced eating habits at an age when lifelong eating patterns and tastes are being formed .
That role finds particular resonance in this age of eating disorders and unhealthy diets .
For example , the increase in the number of obese children in Europe as a result of the culture of sweet , highly coloured fizzy drinks is alarming .
Must we remind people that milk provides a crucial part of our protein , calcium , vitamin and mineral requirements ?
It strengthens the capacity of young children who drink it to protect themselves against diseases caused by nutritional anarchy .
Mr Maat rightly mentions the way eating patterns change with our changing lifestyle .
Increasingly young people go off to school without eating any breakfast or without having any milk in their morning meal .
Nor do we forget that some children from very deprived backgrounds skip breakfast for financial reasons .
These children are exposed to dietary deficiencies and have difficulty concentrating at school .
The Commission is washing its hands of all this , while heading up lots of other programmes that cost a great deal more .
Why undermine the very one which affects the health of European children ?
At a time of upheaval in the role of our schools as a training workshop for life , the distribution of subsidised milk ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for bringing forward a report that not only looks at the problem but puts forward new ideas for the future .
In many countries and areas - such as where I come from in Northern Ireland - young children might not have had the opportunity to have that nourishment and that nutritional support supplied by milk if it had not been for the milk provided to them in schools .
I also hope and trust that they will begin to appreciate and to continue to drink milk .
One thing which amazes me , especially when the agricultural community and dairy farmers are going through such difficult times , is that people are prepared to buy many other products and pay substantial amounts of money for them , but they are not prepared to pay the same amount of money for milk , either for themselves , or for their children .
Milk provides a very healthy and balanced diet , something we should all support .
The European Union should take that on board .
It is good value for money .
We do not always achieve that .
We are in a situation in Europe at the moment where we are pouring millions of euros into the agricultural industry , yet the farmers have never been worse off in their lives .
We have to go back to the drawing board and ask ourselves what our priorities are .
I want to thank Mr Maat .
He has challenged us to look to the future , not just in relation to milk itself , but also to milk products and ways in which we can encourage children to drink milk .
Mr President , for years I have been calling for the school milk scheme to be changed .
I think it is complete nonsense .
It is totally wrong from a nutritional point of view and it is impossible to administer .
Currently , full-cream milk is fully subsidised , semi-skimmed milk is semi-subsidised and skimmed milk receives no subsidy .
The aim of schemes such as this is to do away with surplus stocks , and since full-cream milk contains the most butterfat , it receives the highest subsidy .
We should instead award subsidies per pupil .
I would have preferred it if we had set milk prices lower so that we could abolish the bureaucratic milk quotas .
In the longer term we must change the EU &apos;s agricultural policy so that we can put an end to artificial excess prices and surplus stocks .
However , the school milk scheme is one of the better schemes .
It is not just beneficial to farmers .
The scheme is also to the advantage of children and their parents , especially if it is changed so that it offers subsidies to low-fat products .
Children do not need so much fat .
Furthermore , a scheme with subsidies per pupil would be much easier to administer .
There is an enormous amount of administration involved in the present scheme .
I have received many complaints from schools which cannot work out how to administer the scheme .
It is a real science calculating the fat percentages in milk and cheese .
The schools often end up having to pay back large sums .
It is not that they are out to cheat ; they simply cannot work out how to administer the scheme .
I think , therefore , that we must vote for the amendments of my good colleague and friend , Niels Busk .
The scheme which he is recommending is administratively and nutritionally the only correct one .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Maat , for his report , which I support in its entirety .
And thanks as ever for the usual good work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I would also like to thank my good colleague and close friend , Freddy Blak , of the Socialist Group , for his support for my amendment .
The school milk scheme concerns health and nutrition .
Children and infants must learn healthy eating habits , and milk , with its protein and calcium content , is a very important part of this .
On behalf of the Liberal Group , Mr Pesälä and I put forward three amendments which basically aim to make the school milk scheme a lot easier to administer , but which also seek to make the scheme more flexible with regard to the products which are subsidised .
There are various traditions relating to which dairy products are consumed , and the scheme is simplified by awarding the subsidy on the basis of a quarter of a litre of milk per pupil per school-day .
For products other than full-cream milk , the subsidy should be calculated on the basis of low-fat solids or a maximum butterfat content of 50 % .
In this way the scheme takes account of the differences in the milk traditions which exist in the different Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Commission proposal to henceforth fund the school milk programme by means of 50 % cofinancing has evoked a furious response in the Council and in Parliament .
As soon as the term cofinancing is mentioned in terms of agriculture , people &apos; s hackles rise .
Many see cofinancing as the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also against the Commission &apos; s plans .
With such a viewpoint , Parliament can make the most of it .
Will we read in the newspaper tomorrow &quot; European Parliament in favour of school milk subsidies - to the rescue of the dairy sector &quot; ?
Are we not kidding ourselves and the sector with this attitude ?
Is massive opposition to cofinancing in the interests of the sector in the long term ?
I do not think so .
We shall have to make do with the financial package established in Agenda 2000 and to deal with the enlargement of the Union .
If agricultural policy is not changed we shall not be able to pay for it .
The Union should develop its policy within this context .
The main question here is , how can we operate as efficiently as possible with the limited resources of the European Union ?
Must we continue to burden the agriculture budget with a school milk programme of about EUR 90 million a year ?
Is it not more sensible to seek possibilities of financing such programmes elsewhere ?
If we wish to guarantee the agricultural sector a reasonable level of support , then that is urgently required .
If we do not do that , then the Commission will undoubtedly try in other ways to remain below the agricultural ceiling .
What do you think about a reduction on the direct income supplements ?
Those who are against cofinancing bring such painful economies a lot closer .
We do not wish to be part of that .
Relieving the EU budget by means of creative solutions , such as cofinancing , seems to us a better option for the agricultural sector itself .
Finally , I agree with the objection to the fact that school milk is distributed to people at meetings in this building who certainly do not need it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank Mr Maat very sincerely for the effort he has made to present a balanced report on the Commission proposal .
You will have seen from the debate that the school milk scheme is a very sensitive issue indeed , on which there are many different shades of opinion , and that means that he certainly did not have an easy job .
Some of the amendments proposed in Mr Maat &apos; s report in effect totally reject the Commission proposal .
I cannot therefore accept the amendments in question , which are Amendments Nos 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 and 12 .
I am still convinced that the cofinancing proposed would promote the commitment of state and municipal authorities - and that of school authorities and the dairy industry - which is , in turn , a prerequisite for the success of all of these efforts .
It is quite simply wrong to say that the level of aid will drop from schoolchildren &apos; s point of view .
The level of aid will remain the same , only the source of funding will change , and no one can seriously maintain that aid is only good if it comes totally from the Community budget .
I am also quite happy to concede that there are health , nutrition and social policy objectives here .
But there is one point I wish to make , and this is also the reason why a particular Treaty article has been taken as the legal basis here : in the field of agricultural policy , we can only justify aid that leads to additional sales .
If the real objective is to take social policy or health policy measures , then these should be financed under health and social policy and not , as it were , through the back door .
Amendments Nos 2 , 4 and 9 are designed to cover a broader range of milk products under the scheme .
In this respect the Commission would like to maintain the existing scheme , in which the selection of subsidised products is a matter for the Commission .
Although I cannot therefore accept these amendments , I have no problems with the underlying message , which it is worth conveying , and that is that the current range of products needs to be reviewed , and I will ensure that this issue continues to be dealt with and discussed in the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products .
Lastly , Amendment No 3 is in the form of a statement , so that I do not think it would be appropriate to incorporate the text into the regulation .
As regards the practical side of the proposal , I fear that this amendment would lead to varying levels of support in different Member States and to dramatic fluctuations in the level of aid within a short time .
And as I am sure that no one would want that , it would be better to keep the existing provision , which is clear , based on objective criteria and which guarantees general stability .
For the same reasons , I am unable to accept Amendments Nos 8 and 10 , which are designed to link the level of aid to milk components other than fat .
Finally , Amendments Nos 8 and 9 are intended to make it clear that the aid will be paid for a fixed quantity of milk per schoolchild per day .
This would essentially mean maintaining the existing position , so that is in fact another argument as to why these amendments cannot be accepted .
Thank you for your attention .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Vertical Restraints
The next item is the report ( A5-0077 / 2000 ) by Mrs Thyssen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on draft guidelines on Vertical Restraints ( C5-0009 / 2000 - 2000 / 2003 ( COS ) ) .
Mr President , this debate on the guidelines on vertical restraints is the last in a series of four on an extremely technical subject , for now anyway .
Industry is all too aware of the importance of the Community competition policy for its operations , but let us also not forget that fair , enforceable and sound competition rules also affect the consumer .
I have the impression that for people who are not familiar with the competition policy , the whole question of vertical restraints between companies seems a rather strange business , but the fact is that a large proportion of daily distribution is made , managed and organised on the basis of the rules of vertical restraints .
I did intend , Mr President , to provide my colleagues with a bit more information on this subject , but I can now see how few people are in the Chamber and I think I should not waste your time and the interpreters &apos; time on this .
The Commissioner knows the subject and the Members who are still to speak on this matter know at least as much as I do about it .
I shall therefore just say that I think that we as a Parliament , and as the rapporteur on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , can say that it is a good thing that the Commission draws up guidelines and that it publishes them .
The Commission is the European competition authority par excellence and everyone and certainly legal security will benefit if it explains its new policy in detail beforehand .
Secondly , I hope the Commission will incorporate the comments listed in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which I shall not repeat here , in the final version of the guidelines that will soon be published and I should also like to hear that from you personally , Commissioner .
I should now like to ask a few questions .
First of all , are we going to receive the evaluation which we asked for after three or four years of new policy in the sphere of vertical restraints ?
Secondly , when can we expect the proposals for a new policy for the horizontal agreements , a new policy that has also been announced by the Commission ?
Thirdly , the automobile distribution contracts for the time being fall outside the new policy , but the regulation for this sector expires in 2002 .
We can expect an evaluation to be made this year by the Commission .
When will we receive it and has the Commission already consulted the automobile distribution sector and particularly the small distributors ?
Fourthly , despite everything , we still have a very fundamental question , a question that we have repeatedly raised in vain and I must therefore repeat it again here ; why has the Commission nevertheless opted to apply the new policy immediately also to those sectors where the competition policy , as it was hitherto organised , operated perfectly well ?
In conclusion , Mr President , I should like to thank those Members - unfortunately they are not here in the Chamber - who also dealt with this subject in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , not only for this report , but also for the three reports that preceded it .
I wish to inform those who tabled amendments , that is , amendments tabled on behalf of the PSE Group , that I have unfortunately had to reject those amendments by reason of their content as I explained earlier in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and secondly , because these amendments had already been tabled at Committee level and rejected one by one .
Mr President , I should finally like to apologise for the fact that I cannot be present at the vote tomorrow morning , but Mr von Wogau will replace me here as rapporteur , if necessary .
Mr President , Commissioner , my colleague , Mrs Thyssen has produced some excellent work and I wish to congratulate her on it .
In this connection , I myself would like to comment just on the relevant production markets and the guidelines for interpretation regarding how market share is determined , especially from the point of view of cooperation agreements in the petrol station business .
These issues cause problems , at least in my home country of Finland , and in other small Member States .
Guidelines on vertical restraints should be designed to help us see clearly and accurately when the seller &apos; s market share in the relevant product market exceeds the 30 % threshold to be applied .
Regarding cooperation agreements in the petrol station business , the draft guidelines to be applied do not at present take sufficiently clear account of the special features of that industry &apos; s market and delivery agreements .
The 30 % market share limit provided for under the Block Exemption regulation will cause problems relating to equal treatment for existing petrol stations , at least in Finland .
Applying the new ruling might lead to situations where , for example , we will be inspecting in a different manner the contractual obligations regarding cooperation in the petrol station industry that are otherwise comparable in every respect with each other as far as their direct effects are concerned if the market share of one company exceeds the 30 % threshold .
It is important to define unambiguously the relevant markets referred to in Article 3 of the Block Exemption regulation .
The guidelines have not defined sufficiently precisely how the market share of a manufacturer and a wholesaler should be determined .
I feel this is especially problematic .
As this is a matter of regulating the right of competition in an industry in which competition takes place among brand names , the guidelines should clearly state that calculating market shares should always involve studying each stage of delivery separately .
In addition , the guidelines should indicate unambiguously that the 30 % threshold in the relevant market has been calculated to take account of sales of the supplier &apos; s own brand to the retailer or distributor .
Mr President , I am pleased that you knew I was here and that I was going to speak .
You know that I do not usually speak too long .
I will simply explain the amendments presented by Mr Berenguer , who is unable to attend .
These are Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 4 .
Amendment No 2 deals with the possibility of freeing the distributor by means of the return of contributions once the contract has finished .
The formula used is contained in section 147 of the Commission guidelines on this subject , which is known as the investment depreciation period .
The possibility should exist , in certain circumstances , of freeing the distributor by means of a reintegration of the investment .
In other words , the distributor should not be permanently bound by the initial investment of the producer .
Amendment No 3 refers to the setting of prices by the producer - the resale price - in certain cases , such as the launch of the product .
There are certain cases in which this setting of the resale price can be justified .
This is referred to in sections 38 and 39 of the Commission guidelines , but it is clear that , in certain cases , we have to provide flexibility and we are sure that the Commission will understand this .
Lastly , Amendment No 4 refers to the protection of producers against pressures applied by the distributor to force them to extend the contract .
We are talking about exclusive contracts , sections 131 et seq .
Finally , these amendments are simply intended to be a reminder of certain specific aspects , but it is clear that both the guidelines proposed by the Commission and Mrs Thyssen &apos; s report move within boundaries which are reasonable and practical .
We hope that the Commission will administer these guidelines in a flexible way so that , on the one hand , market competition is guaranteed and , on the other , we do not create situations of enslavement or limitation of economic activity with regard to the distributors .
Mr President , as we are short of time I will make my statement telegram style .
First of all , many thanks to you , Mrs Thyssen , for your excellent report .
Second , my thanks also to the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for supporting this important reform project .
The draft is an important step in the reform of competition policy in respect of vertical restraints .
Since the Green Paper was published in 1997 , the development of the institution of vertical distribution restraints has gone through various phases , including most recently the adoption of new Regulation 2790 on the application of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the Treaty to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices .
As you know , the Commission is taking this policy as a basis for a decisive switch from a traditional approach based on formal criteria to an approach based on the analysis of economic impacts .
The objective of this is to re-establish freedom of contract for the great majority of companies and to simultaneously improve the protection of fair competition for the benefit of consumers .
Furthermore , in answer to your question , Mrs Thyssen , as to whether there will be a review , the answer is yes , there will indeed be a review of the guidelines after four years .
With regard to your question about horizontal measures , the Commission is currently drawing up a set of guidelines relating to this horizontal cooperation agreement .
A first draft of these guidelines will then be transmitted to the European Parliament before it is published in the Official Journal .
It is very likely that this will happen before the end of April .
I am delighted to report that the European Parliament and the Commission have worked together closely and constructively on this issue .
Mrs Thyssen &apos; s report demonstrates once more that this will to cooperate is making a valuable contribution to various relevant aspects of the reform process .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , I should like to say that I cast a vote in error yesterday afternoon on the question of referring the bananas issue back to committee .
We in this Parliament risk setting ourselves on a course which will fail to help the banana growers and , at the same time , will continue to inflict grave injustice on small enterprises engaged in producing things like bath products and ...
... I therefore wish I had cast my vote the other way .
I wish that to be placed on the record .
We will include this in the Minutes , Mr MacCormick .
( The Minutes were approved )
Mr President , I only wanted to report my presence for the Minutes .
I will not be signing the attendance register as I am leaving in one hour , but I wanted everyone to know that I am here .
We can all see , Mrs Van der Laan , that you are here .
It will be included in the Minutes .
Vote
Mr President , we were somewhat confounded yesterday by an action of a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , but I think that what I am about to announce will not come as a surprise to anyone here , as I explained at length on Monday what I am about to request.In fact , you have also received several e-mails and I have also written to the Conference of Presidents on the matter .
The fact is that according to Members of various groups , the agenda on Fridays is too light , as a result of which many Members genuinely believe that their time can be spent more productively elsewhere .
Consequently , there are few of us here today and we cannot guarantee that our electorate is adequately represented here .
We therefore believe that a choice needs to be made : either we need to give more substance to Friday &apos; s agenda or to abolish the Friday sitting .
In this context , I wish to ask for the quorum to be checked .
I think that we all know the rules by now .
Mrs Buitenweg , you cannot request this on your own .
Such a request must be made by at least 32 Members .
I will check if there are sufficient Members present who wish to check the quorum .
I notice that more than 32 Members have made this request .
We will have to establish whether there is a quorum .
You will undoubtedly know that there is a quorum if one third of the MEPs are present in the Chamber .
( The number of Members present was counted )
I note that there is no quorum and that the vote on the Pesälä report will therefore take place in the next part-session .
Mr President , firstly I would like to ask you to determine an exact figure and to carry out an electronic check during the roll-call vote so that we know who is here and who is not .
Secondly , I would like to say that I share the concern of my colleagues who want to upgrade Fridays .
I am always here as a member of the so-called &quot; Friday Club &quot; .
I also want to upgrade Fridays , but through work and not through sabotage .
Mr Posselt , the Rules of Procedure , which I have followed to the letter , are very clear on this and do not allow the electronic voting system to be used .
They also specify that the outcome of the vote shall not be made known .
It is up to the President to establish that there is no quorum .
Report by Mr Maat ( A5-0074 / 200 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in milk and milk products &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 608 - C5-0047 / 2000 - 1999 / 0246 ( CNS ) &#93;
Mr President , I am pleased to say that I , together with a number of other colleagues from my Group , fully back the initiative which Mrs Buitenweg has taken .
Needless to say , we do not aim to sabotage the work.This is why we announced this action a long time ago - the Conference of Presidents were made aware of it six weeks ago - and neither is this any reflection on today &apos; s agenda , of course .
I think that the outcome of the quorum count is sufficient reason for the Conference of Presidents to revise the agenda for 2001 , but at the moment I would like to ask you the following : according to my interpretation of the Rules of Procedure , the request for the quorum means that none of the votes can take place .
If this is not the case , Mr President , I would ask you to check the quorum before we proceed to vote on the Maat report .
( More than 32 Members rose in support of this request )
( The President established that there was not a quorum )
Mr President , I have been trying to catch your eye for a while now .
I note that the Members who are now asking for the quorum to be checked are the Dutch Members , or a number of Dutch Members , who do not usually attend .
Mr President , we have checked when exactly these people are present on Fridays .
It appears that , evidently , no Friday is important enough for these people to turn up .
They have had their little pleasures , Mr President .
They were able to appear on radio and television last week .
Mr President , is that the only way they can think of to sabotage our work here , by soiling the nest of so many other Members who , just like me , are trying to do a decent job here today .
Mr President , I cannot accept this and would like to offer my apologies as I feel ashamed on their behalf .
I would also like to say to these Members , if they had worked like I have in recent months and if they had been given the mandate from the electorate personally , they would behave differently today .
I notice that a few other Members would like to be given the floor on this point of order .
We should , however , bring this to a close very shortly .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Schulz .
Mr President , I will not actually speak for very long , but , so far , if I disregard the comments made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , only those in favour of the process have been allowed to speak .
We do have individual opinions within our Group .
The delegates in the Socialist Group are not unanimous here .
I would therefore like to speak as someone who is against this process .
I would ask the Members who this morning requested that the vote be postponed in the absence of a quorum to consider the following : if you want to reform the Rules of Procedure , which are indispensable in this House , if you want to improve our working practice , you cannot achieve this through impulsive actions ; instead you must initiate a full debate on reform of the House .
The delegates who are here this morning , who have done their work , who spent yesterday evening preparing for the work to be carried out today , are being punished here today , by a spontaneous action , for the fact that not everyone in Parliament has done their homework .
I do not think this is fair to these delegates !
Finally , I would ask you to consider the following , and I am addressing this to my colleagues in the Greens and in the left-wing Groups of this House , who have the somewhat remarkable impression that through the Rules of Procedure you can change the free mandate into an imperative mandate with a duty to be present for all votes .
That is nonsense ! You will never be able to compel a freely elected delegate to take part in a parliamentary session or a vote if that delegate does not want to .
This is why I consider this morning &apos; s action to be impulsive , although it did perhaps serve a purpose , but , in terms of highlighting the key issue , it was quite unhelpful !
( Applause )
Mr President , I feel that we are making rather a spectacle of ourselves.I am reminded of the priest who berates his parishioners because other people do not come to Church .
We are here to work and those who are not here to work are preventing us from doing so .
Mr Schulz is right.This is completely immoral .
Secondly , Mr President , I would like us to get on with the debate.Even if the fact that we do not meet the quorum means that we cannot vote , we can still debate .
Thirdly , I would like to point out the absurdity of the Rules of Procedure and ask the President to see that the matter is referred to the relevant Committee , for our Rules of Procedure state that the quorum cannot be required if less than 32 Members are present .
Therefore , if there had only been 29 Members present we could have voted and no one could have stopped us , but , because there are more than 32 , we cannot vote !
This is absurd , and we are making a spectacle of ourselves in front of the whole of Europe .
We cannot go on like this .
Mr Bourlanges , I can perhaps put your mind at rest by informing you that I will , of course , refer this morning &apos; s matter to the Bureau .
Needless to say , we will discuss this matter .
I think that goes without saying .
For the rest , as President , I am at your service at the moment and I , together with yourself , need to apply the Rules of Procedure to the best of my ability .
I still have many requests from Members to speak .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Medina Ortega .
Mr President , since there will no doubt be another quorum vote , I would like to remind the President and the Members of this Parliament that , during a quorum vote , it is not permitted to leave the chamber .
Four MEPs have left the chamber .
The practice often consists of asking for the quorum and then leaving the chamber .
I would ask you , Mr President , to remember this and not to allow any MEP to leave the chamber while a count of those Members present is taking place .
Mr Medina Ortega , we need to straighten a few things out .
We are now working within the Rules of Procedure .
Since the start of the new parliamentary term , it has been defined very clearly that every Member is allowed to leave the Chamber .
If , however - and this is according to the Rules of Procedure - one of the 32 Members who have requested a quorum leaves the Chamber , they will still be included .
The doors will remain open .
This is the quorum provision as it stands at the moment and this is the one I am applying .
Mr Bourlanges said that we carry on voting if there are fewer than 32 Members in the Chamber.This is not the case .
The Rules of Procedure stipulate that if there are fewer than 32 Members in total present in the Chamber , then there is no vote .
Mr Posselt , there are many points of order to cover .
I am giving you the floor for the last time .
Mr President , I think it is genuinely important .
I appeal to the delegates to end their demonstration .
They have made their point , but now it is a matter of hunger in Ethiopia and we must vote on it .
Motions for resolutions ( B5-0345 / 2000 , B5-0348 / 2000 , B5-0360 / 2000 , B5-0392 / 2000 , B5-0395 / 2000 ) on the famine in Ethiopia
Mr President , I am very sorry but we did announce this action six weeks ago - it has not exactly appeared out of the blue .
We have given everyone , including the Presidents , the opportunity to change the agenda if this was considered necessary .
Nobody acted upon this .
I have not heard of any action to change the agenda , even on the part of the Members who are now complaining .
This action , the quorum action , will continue , not only today , but every Friday in Strasbourg , until we have achieved our goal .
One of the options is a full Chamber , because one thing that creates the bad image which Mr Bourlanges is talking about is people signing up here and leaving without doing their work .
I have also done my homework and I do not want to mention any names , but we will be able to do this in future .
We will challenge the quorum for each item on the agenda today.This will cause some irritation .
It seems more sensible , therefore , to move all votes for today.We then do not need to continue with this and we can carry on with the debates and ask the Commissioner important questions .
Mrs Van der Laan , I understand that you would like the quorum to be checked .
According to the Rules of Procedure , a vote is to be taken on this .
We need to check whether there are 32 Members who wish to support you .
( More than 32 Members rose in support of this request ) ( The President established that there was no quorum )
Mr President , irrespective of whether this action was spontaneous or premeditated , it is still an act of sabotage by the anti-Strasbourg lobby .
I , too , noticed Members leaving the Chamber during the count .
This behaviour does not contravene the Rules of Procedure , but it is contrary to the notion of fair play and the proper functioning of Parliament .
( Applause )
I am just so tired of being accused of not wanting to do my job because I am taking part in this action .
If this Parliament is to be taken even a tiny bit seriously in Europe - and it is touch and go whether it will be , given that only 50 % of citizens voted at the last European Parliament elections - then it must take itself seriously , and we are not taking ourselves seriously by sitting and discussing cases when there is nobody here .
That is not a serious way of doing things .
If Parliament has to work on Friday , then people must be here .
What we are asking for is simply confirmation of whether we are observing Parliament &apos; s own rules .
That can hardly be called frivolous .
Mr President , the action which was taken is permitted by the Rules of Procedure , and therefore , those who , like me , acted in this way take political responsibility for it .
I do , however , consider that it is not right to criticise those who use an instrument which was adopted by democratic vote , such as the Rules of Procedure , for purposes which all may not support , but which are nevertheless permitted by the rules which we have established for ourselves .
If the rules had been different , we would have acted differently .
I would ask , rather , why it is that many Members voted in favour of working on Fridays in Strasbourg and yet are not in Strasbourg today .
It might have been better and made more sense to vote not to work on Fridays : in fact , I put it to you that to vote in a certain way and then act differently is a display of blatant disregard for our institution .
Mr President , with regard to Mr Medina Ortega &apos; s intervention a few moments ago , which you responded to by saying that his interpretation was incorrect , I must tell you that your reply was not correct either .
Please do not ask me to name any particular Member , but I guarantee that some of the 32 members who voted in favour of the request for a quorum are no longer here .
Therefore , some of the 32 Members have violated the Rules of Procedure .
Report by Mrs Thyssen ( A5-0077 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the draft guidelines on vertical restraints &#91; C5-0009 / 2000 - 2000 / 2003 ( COS ) &#93;
Mr President , you will understand that I would like the quorum to be checked , but I think that there are clearly not enough people present .
I would therefore suggest moving all planned votes to the next sitting and proceeding with the discussion with the Council .
This is not the way things are done .
You can ask for the quorum to be checked but the vote is on the agenda .
Would you like to get the quorum checked now ?
( More than 32 Members rose in support of this request ) ( The President established that there was no quorum )
Mr President , two points on the Rules of Procedure : the first is that I would ask you , the chair , not just to look to the left , but to kindly look to the right also to see if anyone here wishes to speak .
My second point is an appeal to the delegates .
The point which is currently on the agenda , night flights , gives us the chance to carry out a roll-call vote .
If you want that , and I consider it very reasonable , we should carry out this vote .
Mr Mayer , I can assure you , it is not just me who casts my eye through the Chamber .
I also have people behind my desk who help me in this activity .
We can monitor all corners of the Chamber .
I actually think that I have not made too bad a job of it .
Concerning night flights , these will be discussed in a moment .
We will see how the point on the agenda unfolds .
I am now giving the floor to Mrs Flesch .
Mr President , I am indebted to my esteemed friend , Mrs van der Laan , for making it clear , the last time she adopted a position , that she and her friends intended to repeat the manoeuvre every Friday morning of a Strasbourg part-session .
I am grateful to her for clarifying the purpose of this action and I agree with Mr Jacques Poos &apos; comments .
I would also like to express my disappointment at the absence from the Chamber this morning of Members whom I believed to be as concerned as I am for the interests of the town of Strasbourg .
Mr President , I would just like to ask all those who stood up to request checking the quorum what they think of the fact that , thanks to their action , we are not now going to vote on emergency aid measures for Ethiopia .
In all honesty , I think we need to make journalists aware of what we think of this kind of action .
Everyone is , of course , free to act as they like .
Information and communication
The next item is an oral question to the Commission ( B5-0008 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the EU &apos; s information and communication strategy .
Mr President , the Union is faced with major tasks and its further development depends to a great extent on what we do here and now .
Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is the biggest challenge in the Community &apos; s history , and if we do not tackle the issue correctly now , we are putting a lot at risk .
It is extremely important that we explain to the Union &apos; s citizens , and the citizens of the candidate countries , what the Union stands for .
An information and communication strategy must , therefore , be high on our agenda .
I am looking forward with great interest to hearing your answer , Commissioner Reding , because I know that information is also of great interest to you : an interest which we share , moreover , because we are both journalists by profession .
I believe that we also have the same interest in the Union &apos; s communication and information activities being organised in as close proximity to the citizens as possible and in our applying the policy so that the various groups in society get the information which they most need .
The keywords are coordination - partly when it comes to sharing information between the Commission and the Parliament - decentralisation , targeting and optimum exploitation of the available information technology .
I am curious as to how the Commission will go about the task .
I imagine that the Commission &apos; s offices in the major European cities will be involved and that they will be assigned tasks and responsibilities and given resources to contact and inform the public at large .
The experts , the authorities and those who are genuinely interested in the EU should not have problems getting information , and I must admit that I am a little sceptical when I hear about an &quot; interinstitutional &quot; library in Brussels or similar central functions .
I would much rather that the Commission &apos; s office in Copenhagen was a little more accessible .
It is the Commission &apos; s local offices , in cooperation with Parliament &apos; s local offices , which must meet the man on the street , the man who always thinks that Brussels is so extremely far away .
He must understand that Brussels means all of us together , as Commission President Prodi put it .
It is a very difficult task because , in my opinion , the gap between the citizens and the institutions is wide , and with the major challenges which the Union is facing the task will become no less great .
Enlargement , the Commission &apos; s ambitious 5-year plan , the Commission &apos; s plans for reform , the Intergovernmental Conference : there is a lot to provide information about , and I think that this is an urgent matter .
I believe that you share many of my views , Mrs Reding .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Andreasen for his question since it gives me the opportunity to express the extent to which I share his views , as , indeed , I emphasised during my hearing before this House last September .
It is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and Europe .
It is true that we have all , not just the Commission , but also Parliament and the Member States , made many mistakes in our information policy in the past .
We must all , not just the Commission in isolation but the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and with Parliament , proceed to examine the matter in depth and develop a new information policy .
Moreover , let me tell you quite explicitly that I have taken careful note of the problems which exist .
I must tell you , too , that there are some things which are working well ; it is not all bad .
For instance , we have just started up &apos; Europe direct &apos; , a new access facility for citizens looking for information about Europe .
We have our Euro-info-points and information outlets in the Member States , which , generally speaking , are very successful .
Along with the honourable Member , I admit that we might be able to improve the way they operate , and I shall indeed make every effort to achieve this .
The honourable Member also mentioned modern technology .
Obviously , the new information policy which we are going to be implementing will have to optimise the use of all the information and communication possibilities which this new technology makes available to us .
In my opinion , one of the major mistakes of the past , in our information policy , was the fact that this was often top-down information identified , wrongly , I must say , as propaganda .
That must be taken into consideration .
We must take the psychology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established .
Moreover , I would draw your attention to the fact that my fellow Commissioner , Michel Barnier , and myself , have initiated dialogue on the Intergovernmental Conference which is to follow this new approach , i.e. making contact with the public , with young people and opinion formers , and discussing matters with them , and also approaching locally , regionally and nationally elected representatives on behalf of the Commission , not to make fine speeches , but to discuss things with them and to gain some idea of their general expectations .
I am , of course , counting a great deal on Parliament to play its part in this citizen information campaign .
Parliament is the body which is closest to the citizens , and if all the Members of the European Parliament fulfil their task of informing citizens - and I shall assist them as much as I possibly can to do so - this will enable us to change mindsets .
We have once again started to work within an interinstitutional working party on &apos; information &apos; , in which Parliament is represented , and as part of this work , which is a tripartite effort involving the national states , the European Parliament and the Commission , I plan to present a communication to you in the near future outlining a new approach which I shall first present to the Commission , some time before the summer , and which I shall then discuss with you .
I cannot give you any details at this early stage of the actual proposal , as it is still being drawn up , but I can assure you that the main pillars of this new approach will be decentralisation , subsidiarity , closeness to the citizens , the coresponsibility of the European institutions and the national administrations and also the increased participation of civil society .
I also think we must all clarify our respective roles .
Obviously , the Parliament &apos; s role is different to that of the Commission .
I am deeply convinced that Parliament &apos; s special role must continue .
Any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution .
It is possible to cooperate without the parties involved losing their own identities , but we should nonetheless all work in the same direction and we must know that the closer we are to the citizens , the greater our chances of being comprehensible , credible and effective .
In order to do so , we must seriously examine the way we are organised , the instruments and procedures we select , what is being done at the various levels , at institutional , national and regional level , and how tasks are divided between the three institutions .
We must also , openly and objectively , look at our own way of working and examine how we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past .
That , Mr President , is what I wanted to say for the time being .
Obviously , the discussion is only just being initiated and will not be completed today , because in the very near future we shall be presenting a communication on our new information policy which we are going to discuss in detail with you .
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Reding for her response to Mr Andreasen .
We have a very committed commissioner in Commissioner Reding .
She has a really tough task on her hands but I am sure that she will get the full support that she recognises that she needs from the European Parliament .
I find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the EU .
The information deficit is actually more serious than the democratic deficit that we often talk about .
In a sense , the information deficit and the democratic deficit are part of the same problem .
In the recent past , we have had the Oostlander report in 1993 and the famous Pex report in 1998 .
They have analysed the problem , suggested improvements , but sadly little has been achieved .
I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem .
This week I had a visitors &apos; group from the Winchester Probus Club , mainly retired people and , in general terms , well informed about world affairs .
However , you could write what they knew about the aims of the EU on the back of a one euro note .
Before anyone tells me that euro notes do not exist , it would not make any difference : they could not write anything .
When I speak to British groups , I often start with the question : do you want to be in the European Union ?
The immediate response I got this week was : &quot; No &quot; .
Five or six years ago , the response would have been : &quot; Yes , but we do not want too much interference &quot; .
This situation is getting worse .
I know that it is a particular problem for the United Kingdom , but it is not exclusive to the United Kingdom .
It is getting worse right across Europe .
We only have to look at the turn-out in the European Parliamentary elections to see that .
Why is this so ?
Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU ?
To begin with , we must remember that the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product .
Even if you have a first-class product , if you do not market it properly it will not sell .
We must make sure that the product is good first and then make sure that we advertise it effectively .
I fear we are doing neither .
There can be no doubt that , when history is written , the greatest achievement of the 20th century will be seen to be the creation of the EU .
It has delivered peace and prosperity for half the continent for half the century .
Now the other half of the continent is queuing up to get in , yet my constituents want to get out .
I am not an expert in marketing ;
I know there are no simple solutions ; I certainly know more propaganda leaflets are not the answer .
Let me just suggest a few possibilities .
What happened to President Prodi &apos;s idea of a rapid rebuttal unit ?
If it is in existence , it does not appear to be very effective .
If they are giving answers , can I suggest that they e-mail their answers to the MEPs as well , so we can use the information , not just to the press , who often just spike it .
The Commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good .
We must make more and better use of it .
We must make sure that our website address is known. we could maybe spend some of the Socrates money giving every student in Europe a computer mouse mat so that they can see the website address of the European Parliament .
With the plethora of new TV channels , with digital TV , have we got anywhere with a Parliamentary TV channel ?
I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel.But not the European Parliament .
We must emphasise the good-news stories of when we help the citizen .
We have a Committee on Petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year .
When did the information departments of the Commission or Parliament last attend a meeting of that committee ?
When did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee ?
Finally , I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg .
I am not anti-Strasbourg.I am certainly not anti-France .
I understand that Strasbourg was the symbol of peace and unity of our continent , but that was a symbol of the 20th century .
In the 21st century , I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency .
I ask Parliament , Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to thank you for your interest and dedication to the European Union &apos; s information activities .
We have known you for many years and we know of your commitment and dedication , not only to what we could call the European cause , but also to ensuring that the European cause really reaches the citizens .
In your political activities you have always paid special attention to the most sensitive groups : young people , elderly people , the workplace , and you paid special attention to the media .
We support the general lines which you have put forward here and which will be specified in the document which you will present and which the European Commission must approve next June .
You have mentioned two aspects which I would like to stress : the regional dimension and efficiency .
The aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens .
In order to do that properly it is necessary to take account of the regional dimension , because it is one of the fields which is a subject of great sensitivity in terms of society and its problems .
Therefore , so that the citizens may understand and participate in European construction and not see it as a superstructure reserved for politicians and technocrats , it is essential that the work of providing information is done at the level of the regional institutions and in conjunction with them .
This goes hand in hand with efficiency .
In your review of information policy , I would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain Member States .
For example , during the euro campaign , there was an agreement at the time between the European Commission and the government of a Member State .
That government &apos; s decision was to commission an information campaign on the euro from a very important advertising agency .
That advertising agency made some very nice advertisements and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were distributed .
However , that it is not the way to reach the public , nor is it efficient .
It is perhaps very pleasing to the government , which gets to make fine speeches , and to the relevant Minister , who gets to appear on the television and in the newspapers , but that does not reach the public .
Therefore , it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation .
Mr President , those of us who represent Scotland in this House were very grateful when this year the Parliament decided to make its office in Edinburgh permanent .
The Commission has long had an office there .
The Commissioner has mentioned the importance of national regions , as well as the states , in its communication policy .
I am sorry to say that this week it has been announced that The Scotsman newspaper is closing down the office of its Brussels and European correspondent .
It is rumoured that BBC Scotland is about to remove its special correspondent from Brussels .
That would be a disaster .
It is not just the Commission and Parliament which need to think about their role.Our own media also need to look seriously at the problem of adequately reporting to their citizens the issues of Europe .
May I mention one other sad case , which is of importance in the area of information and communication .
I want to draw attention , yet again , to the case of the Italian language lecturers .
New developments in the case have shown that the quality of openness in information and communication by the Commission on this sort of issue leaves much to be desired .
In these proceedings it is vital that the interested parties are fully informed by the Commission , but the practice fails to honour that ideal .
There has been some evidence this week that the former Commission has actively misled parties in cases of this kind .
During the current Parliament , I have had a number of assurances that the Commission is serious about upholding rights derived from Community law on behalf of lecturers in all issues involving non-discrimination .
That really must be taken seriously .
It is a point about openness , about being ready to communicate what is going on and about informing people how seriously we take rights arising from Community law and how seriously we take the need to demonstrate to our citizens and our public the importance of what is accomplished here .
I am glad that the Commission and Parliament have helped to make information available in Scotland and I wish our own media would do likewise .
Mr President , a distinction must be made between information and propaganda .
Mr Prodi &apos; s Commission has started off badly with regard to information .
I have heard that last autumn it issued an instruction to the national Commission offices to focus on the reporting of political information in place of the former citizens &apos; information service .
This means information and propaganda from above .
Actually , this means the spread of propaganda , not information .
The Commission has started off badly in the most important area of information reporting , that of public accessibility .
The Commission has issued a draft for a directive on public accessibility , which , by any common yardstick , is an untenable document , more conducive to secrecy than increased public accessibility .
This is the Commission &apos; s line on information policy insofar as it concerns public accessibility .
Public accessibility is just as important as information .
It offers our citizens and the media the opportunity to have hands-on access to documents themselves and draw their own conclusions , instead of being dependent on those of the Commission .
There is a very obvious discrepancy between the official documents themselves and the conclusions being drawn .
The documents state that the European Union &apos; s crisis management troops are not a European Army , but the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , says that whatever you call it , it is one .
In an information context such as this , it is important to have access to the documents and draw one &apos; s own conclusions , as the documents do not always spell things out clearly either .
In addition , the way Parliament disseminates information must be criticised .
Parliament has its own information offices , but the Finnish office apparently has no money to buy copies of the EU Treaty , which would allow Members to familiarise themselves with its contents in their office at Parliament .
It has one Internet connection .
To this extent , we could conclude that the officials working in Parliament &apos; s own information office do not know what is going on in Parliament , although Parliament has excellent Internet connections .
To all intents and purposes , it is a war of propaganda that is going on here.In many respects , it is also a civil war .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like once again to point out that Commissioner Reding has announced a dramatic change in the information strategy of the EU and has thus made it clear that there are deficiencies , that fresh efforts must be made and that we must make this issue a focus of our concerns .
We thank you for this .
Secondly , I would like to point out that we too must ask ourselves whether this morning &apos; s initiative to prevent voting was a positive information and communication strategy for Parliament outwardly as well as inwardly ?
I do not think that it was !
The homework which we have to do we must do ourselves and we must not confuse information and communication within the framework of our work with self-promotion .
It is a matter of Community promotion and not self-promotion .
In this regard we should all resolve to understand that one of the causes of the problems of the political parties and of the institutions is a problem of communication and information .
We , and I say that very clearly , the institutions of the European Union , the European Parliament and the delegates cannot bear sole responsibility for providing information on Europe .
Without the support of the Member States , without the support of the public representatives at borough , county and national level , without the support of all the institutions , we will not get directly to the citizen , because either we are here doing our work or we are involved in communication and information processes with our citizens .
We cannot do both at the same time within the meaning of Maastricht and Amsterdam !
Commissioner , I am waiting for your master plan , your schedule , your specific measures for implementation .
The public mandataries , all persons and institutions who receive money from the EU , should be involved in this implementation .
We must increasingly involve the visitor groups and also two areas of activity which , in my opinion , are in your sphere of responsibility , i.e. schools and youth , and the staff in the offices of the Community institutions must be equipped accordingly .
Please submit to us a specific plan of action and a schedule .
Thank you , Mr President .
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for the commitment of those Members who openly support our action and are willing to further a new policy which will , of necessity , be innovative .
In any case , this is the impression I gained from the comments of the honourable Members .
May I first answer Mr Perry .
He said that the situation is getting worse .
That is a very negative way of seeing things .
Probably , the honourable Member is right .
I just hope the situation is not getting worse everywhere .
That would be terrible.But if it is getting worse anywhere , we have to take that very seriously .
We cannot just say that it is getting worse and not do anything .
We have to act .
The new information programme which is going to be set up and which will integrate all the actors at regional and national level will do a lot of good for the future information policy .
Mr Perry has addressed three specific points .
Firstly , the website address should be better known .
I know about this problem .
On 3 April we launched the new access facility - Europe direct .
We will be distributing information about this site to schools and local authorities .
Regarding a Parliamentary TV channel , the Commission would not object if Parliament proposed such an activity .
However , I leave that initiative to Parliament .
Regarding the Committee on Petitions and creating publicity about it , the last time this was done was when I was president of that committee .
I consider it very important .
There are colleagues in this Chamber who sat with me on that committee some years ago .
It is the committee most concerned with the Europe of the citizen .
If Parliament decided to take action vis-à-vis the citizens by utilising the Committee on Petitions , you can rest assured that the Commission would support it .
( FR ) Like Mr MacCormick , Mr Gasòliba i Böhm touched on a major issue related to the fact that centralising the provision of information is not viable .
If information were to be issued solely from Strasbourg or solely from Brussels , it would not reach the public .
I am absolutely sure that , if we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens and the citizens closer to Europe , there must be a regional dimension to the information policy at all levels , including information relating to the euro .
In practice , the euro cannot be introduced by means of a television programme .
We must not forget the importance of television but , in addition and above all , we have to keep the people at grassroots informed - to approach the people and talk to them .
And there are a great many information outlets available to us in our regions , towns and villages which can play a very significant role in this .
It would be a mistake for a policy to be managed solely by an advertising agency and not implemented at grass roots level in consultation with the citizens directly concerned .
I am in total agreement with Mr Gasòliba i Böhm when he says that we must integrate this regional dimension into our information policy and , when I discuss the issue with the competent national politicians , I will ensure that this is taken into account .
( EN ) Along the same lines , I say to Mr MacCormick that I find it regrettable if the Scottish media no longer report what happens in Strasbourg or Brussels .
Of course , I cannot intervene in that respect .
It is a private decision of the media .
In any event it is important for all actors , including Members of the European Parliament , to intervene with the media so that they enhance their reporting about Europe .
Every time I meet with organisations of journalists or organisations of editors , I ask them to give more coverage to the European political level .
The information office in Edinburgh will not be closed.So at least regional policy in this area will continue .
( FR ) Mr Seppänen said that there has been inadequate provision of information to the public and that the Prodi Commission has been too concerned with political propaganda .
I hope that the honourable Member is wrong and that the provision of information will not ultimately be perceived in this way .
In any case , the channel which I will announce in the written statement , which I am in the process of drawing up at the moment , is dialogue and direct contact with the citizen .
I would like to make it quite clear , once again , that the provision of information to citizens is not the exclusive responsibility of the Commission .
I am convinced that this information service can work properly only if there is close cooperation between the three institutions in question .
If we do not cooperate , we will fail miserably .
( DE ) I thank Mr Karas for regarding the ways and means with which we will , in future , tackle information policy as a positive approach .
I strongly agree with him that everyone must take a look at themselves to see where we have gone wrong .
I have no intention of going into the problems of the information policy of Parliament .
The parliamentarians must do that themselves , but we should all carry out Community promotion together .
Mr Karas has quite rightly said that we need the Member States .
That is also one of the focuses of the new information policy which I would like to introduce in the future .
We need not only the Member States , but also the associations , regional and national politicians .
Without them there is no way that we can get our information across .
There must therefore be a concerted action between the institutions and between the people in our regions , in our States .
I know that this is easy to say and difficult to implement .
But unless we at least make a start , then nothing will happen .
I hope , therefore , that on the basis of the new information policy , which I would like to introduce , this aspect of citizen participation and citizen responsibility for Europe will be strongly emphasised .
( FR ) Mr President , I cannot bring about a revolution single-handed .
Clearly , I need a large number of soldiers and aides , and I need you , each and every one of you individually , to assist me wherever you have influence or responsibilities in this new information campaign.This is a joint effort .
It is a great challenge , but I know I can count on your support .
( Applause )
Thank you , Commissioner .
This is probably the first time I have heard delegates referred to as soldiers , but we know what role we are playing here .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , in the heated debate on the matter of the quorum I did not get a chance to speak before about my motion for the Rules of Procedure .
Yesterday , there was a question from Mr MacCormick on the postponement of the vote on the COM for bananas .
I share the concerns of Mr MacCormick .
We requested the postponement so that we could remain involved as a Parliament in the communication process with the United States within the WTO .
Had we voted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure , we would no longer have been involved .
That is how it was , Mr MacCormick - he is no longer here .
I would like this to be recorded .
It is to do with the fact that we as a Parliament no longer have the right to codecision in the agricultural sector and so we had to choose this path .
I am taking note of this .
This will be taken care of .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Beysen on a point of order .
Mr President , I have noticed with some degree of satisfaction that the subversive action staged by some of the Members with a view to sabotaging procedures has ground to a halt .
This will probably be because they have come to realise that they cannot count on the support of at least 32 delegates .
I would just like to say , Mr President , that some strange selectivity is being practised here , that certain Members stage little acts and , after the act is finished , they leave and the game is over .
I did want to point this out because Parliament should not be mistaken for a kindergarten , and this is the feeling I will have when I leave this Chamber today .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start the debate .
Let us not enter into discussion .
I will tell you what the Rules of Procedure are so that we all know where we stand .
I am now giving the floor to Mr Van Hulten .
Mr President , our action is not finished .
I simply want to refute that our sole aim would be to disturb proceedings .
What we do want is to make sure that this Parliament can work more effectively and be more credible for the next five years.This is what we are doing .
We hope that we can count on the support of all MEPs to arrange the agenda in such a way as to actually make this happen in future , as you explained so well on television this week , Mr President .
Mr President , I may have been accused of being subversive , but other people appear to disregard the Rules of Procedure.A request to test the quorum should not be made at the start of the debate but when we vote .
Mr Speroni , let us be absolutely clear about this .
According to Rule 126 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure : &quot; Parliament may deliberate , settle its agenda and approve the Minutes of proceedings , whatever the number of Members present &quot; .
Deliberation is always possible .
We will shortly proceed to the vote ( details will follow ) , and we will then see what happens .
I am presiding over the meeting according to the agenda as it is before us .
I am now giving the floor to Mrs Gebhardt and I hope we will then proceed to the next item on the agenda , which is night flights .
Mr President , I would like to ask a question , tongue-in-cheek , in the style of Loriot .
Where are they then ? Where are they then , those who say that we should do proper work here , who are always putting the question about the quorum and , when we are doing the real work here , are absent ?
Where are these 32 and more who stood up before and who will stand up again , but who now , when we are discussing matters , are no longer here ?
I would really like to know what kind of nonsense this is ?
Night flights and excessive noise
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Lannoye for this initiative and for launching the debate in this Chamber on this very important matter .
One of the goals of the Commission communication &apos; Air transport and the environment - towards sustainable development &apos; is precisely to launch the debate on the suitability of establishing a Community framework for decision-making procedures concerning the operational restrictions to be imposed on airports in the Union for environmental reasons .
In the course of this debate , which will be held in the different institutions , the Council of Ministers and Parliament will have the chance to express their views on this communication , both in general terms and with regard to specific aspects such as night flights .
As pointed out in this communication , the Commission does not see how uniform and restrictive rules governing restrictions on use , which would apply to all Community airports , as would be the case , for example , for the general ban on night flights , could provide the most balanced solution to the issue of noise pollution attributable to certain airports .
The Commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level .
However , it also considers that a common framework is necessary to coordinate the procedures adopted in order to reach these decisions so that when a region decides to ban night flights , for example , it does so in the same way as a similar region somewhere else .
And this framework could make it compulsory for all the interested parties to be consulted , stipulate an appropriate timeframe for adaptation to the new restrictions and establish a common basis for assessing the efficiency in environmental terms of the envisaged measures restricting operations .
I would also like to touch on the subject of hushkits .
With regard to speeding up the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft , the Commission is committed to the work currently in progress within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on drafting a new standard on noise and rules for the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft .
If , as we hope , all goes according to plan , this work will result in the 33rd Assembly of the ICAO adopting new , binding international noise regulations in September 2001 .
Compared with the hushkits regulation , which is content to put a freeze on the current situation for aircraft whose certificate has been renewed , genuine international rules requiring the progressive withdrawal of these devices would have greater effect in terms of environmental protection .
Meanwhile , in view of the United States &apos; refusal to back down over the hushkits regulation , the provisions of this regulation on banning the attachment of these devices will enter into force on 4 May next .
Given that the provisions governing the banning of aircraft registered in third countries will only come into force on 1 April 2002 , the Commission &apos; s interpretation of the conclusions of the 33rd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation will provide all the elements necessary to decide whether it is appropriate to replace the hushkits regulation with rules for progressive withdrawal adopted at international level .
All this is in the pipeline.The Commission is working on it and would like to thank Parliament for its cooperation on this matter .
I have received four motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 42 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The vote will take place after the debate .
Mr President , noise pollution caused by aircraft is a very topical issue .
We talked about hushkits not so long ago .
I understand from the observations made by the Commissioner that the regulation as it has been laid down will enter into force on 4 May next .
Mr President , it is not only hushkits which are causing us considerable concern .
In broader terms too , we have to establish that , on account of the increase in air traffic , noise pollution is growing at an alarming rate , especially for citizens who live near busy airports .
At night time , in particular , this level of pollution is out of all proportion .
The number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced .
But what is meant by night ?
At Düsseldorf airport , night falls at 10 p.m. , according to Mr Florenz .
We in the Netherlands are far more flexible in this respect.Night does not set in until 1.00 a.m. and we do not actually term it night , we refer to it as the brink of night .
Mr President , whatever time we are talking about , it means that we need a coherent approach to noise pollution caused by the transport of civilians and freight by air , as the individual Member States are applying very different rules .
These lead to the direct and undesired effect that airports start to compete with each other.They reason that as long as they are flexible enough , they will get a lot of freight traffic .
But , at the end of the day , it is the people living near airports who suffer .
Mr President , so what needs to happen ?
First of all , all noise pollution , including pollution generated by aircraft , must be tackled at source .
This means thorough research into low-noise engines .
This means bans and international standards .
But it also means that we need European framework legislation which ensures that measurements are taken , standards set , zonal structures put in place in the same way for all European airports .
What we are asking for - not for the first time , in fact , we did this two and a half years ago in connection with the report on noise pollution which was supported by the late Mrs Carmen Diez de Riviera - is this legislation .
Commissioner and Mrs Reding - you are representing Mrs de Palacio at the moment - you are saying that this is extremely difficult , but I am not asking you for a ban , or even a night ban .
What I do want is to keep the discussion around this issue going and to continue where Parliament left off before .
It was our own amendment , tabled on behalf of the European People &apos; s Party .
Let us thus fight for a European directive which , thanks to Mrs Loyola de Palacio &apos; s new impetus , ensures that we - at long last - can give our citizens what is theirs .
That is peace and quiet at night , but this also implies a proper zonal structure , insulation and sound legislation in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the airline industry has become a growing as well as a thriving industry within the Union .
This undoubtedly brings many benefits , but there are also many drawbacks .
I would like to make it clear straight away that , if Europe does not intervene , aspects such as quality of life , the economy and social factors will very much be in the balance .
The key question is , do we want our citizens to enjoy a good night &apos; s rest , and even day &apos; s rest and , secondly , are we able to give them just that ?
If you will allow me , I will dwell for a moment on the problem of noise pollution suffered at my own country &apos; s national airport , an airport which , by the way , many of you frequent very regularly .
The noise pollution at Zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time .
The quality of life - and sleep - of the people living in the vicinity is appalling by any standard .
The solution to this problem has caused great uproar in Belgium and in my government .
As you know , the Belgian Government embraces people from the blue , green and red sections of the political spectrum .
Well , when the green Minister had the audacity to propose a complete night ban , all of a sudden , Belgium was not big enough for the fierce discussion which followed .
Commissioner , you may be red and green in your heart , and I can assure , this is what I am .
I too want to continue to promote life and the quality of everyone &apos; s existence as the supreme good .
This is all well and good on paper , but this can be very difficult to implement in practice .
What is worse ?
Having a very difficult or bad night &apos; s sleep , day in day out , or suddenly losing your job and your income ?
Indeed , the parcel company at Zaventem had threatened hundreds , if not many more , redundancies .
All of a sudden , the trade union and employers joined forces .
Belgium has meanwhile come up with a solution : a combination of measures which involves a restriction of noise at source , strict supervisory measures and a number of infrastructural planning measures , such as offering insulation to the houses affected .
It is an improvement , but not a solution .
Too many people continue to suffer from excessive noise in their bedrooms .
Nonetheless , Belgium , in tandem with other Member States , has taken on a pioneering role in this discussion and the question is then , will that country , with its businesses and people who work and live there , suffer as a result ?
We can only avoid this if night flights and noise pollution are tackled at European level .
This is , in fact , what we are asking for and I am delighted to see that people of all political persuasions in this Parliament are asking for the same thing.I therefore hope that the Commission will be receptive to this .
Europe will need to resolve the false dilemma that exists of having to choose between the economy and social and environmental considerations .
We would like a standardised method to measure noise pollution within the Union .
In this connection , we would also like uniform standards and an effective costing rule .
In addition , we would like criteria which determine when a night ban should be instituted within the Union .
In a recent communication from the Commission on air transport and the environment , an initial strategy has already been outlined .
This is to be welcomed , but it is not enough .
Firstly , this does not solve the current problem , as Mr Lannoye has already pointed out .
Secondly , this is simply a communication , but we want hard legislation from the Commission , so that everyone knows where they stand .
I regret that the Commissioner - the Commissioner who is standing in for Commissioner de Palacio that is - is of the opinion that it is very difficult to institute a night ban .
I think that , with a little good will , this should be feasible .
I am looking forward to her reply .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Lannoye stated a moment ago that noise is a problem with all forms of transport , but the problem with aircraft is very specific because it is so concentrated .
In its communication on airports and the environment , the Commission mentioned a few things about noise , one being - and you also echoed this yourself - that the principle of subsidiarity applies to noise.In other words , it must be possible to implement at local level without the European Union having to regulate everything .
I would , however , like the Commission &apos; s guarantee that distortion of competition is ruled out.An interesting concept in the communication is the drafting of classification lists , not only for aircraft , but also for airports .
This would mean that noise-sensitive airports would be distinguished from others and that certain activities could not take place at such airports but could possibly take place at less noise-sensitive airports .
Mrs Van Brempt already pointed this out : we are faced with a dilemma .
It is clear that certain businesses and a certain economic sector totally rely on night flights.If we asked them what would happen if there were no night flights , they are bound to say that they would have to close down their businesses , their activities would become pointless and they would no longer be able to offer their services .
Our question is , therefore : how can we marry the two together ?
The Commission should then legislate against distortion of competition between different airports in different Member States .
Mrs Van Brempt clearly stated what the dilemma was for the Belgian Government .
It is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea .
As it happens , the Belgian Government has taken a number of measures , but would it not be useful , for example , if the Commission were to compile some sort of list of good and bad airline companies in terms of noise , if it were to draw a distinction between those who do invest in combating noise , those who can present a good record in combating noise and those who cannot , those who do not try their best , and then combine this with measures .
Because one thing is clear : noise must be penalised .
Accordingly , it should be more expensive to fly certain aircraft and it should be impossible to fly certain aircraft at night for example .
A total ban would be ideal , of course , but can we afford this and where could this be done ?
We would like to have these questions answered by the Commission .
A European framework is lacking at the moment - and you say yourself that a framework should be in place , but when ?
When will this happen ?
We have a communication at the moment and shortly we will have the report by Mrs Lucas on aviation and the environment , but when are we getting legislation , when can we expect a framework which is sufficiently clear for each Member State , so that distortion of competition is ruled out ?
Would it not be useful , for example , to look at &apos; best practices &apos; at this stage - to use a buzz word - so that we know what certain airports get up to ?
This would be some achievement.For example , at Schiphol , there is a kind of complaints desk for noise .
Other airports do not have this but could possibly do with one .
So why not exchange ideas between the different EU airports , where all of us are faced with the same problem ?
I would ask the Commission to speed up its process and not to wait for the legislative measure alone , but to set up other initiatives in order to bring people closer together .
Mr President , Commissioner , yesterday the inhabitants of Strasbourg forced decision makers to reject the well-known air courier firm , DHL &apos; s , plans to set up a base at the Strasbourg-Entzheim airport .
Now the company is trying to worm its way into the Nancy-Metz regional airport , which it has targeted because of its rural location where , due to the lower population density , there might appear to be less public opposition .
But this is not the case at all .
When it comes to noise pollution from aircraft and public health in general , it makes no difference whether an airport is situated in the town or the country : all citizens have the right to a peaceful night &apos; s sleep .
I could also mention the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Roissy , Satolas and Milan who are protesting.Milan has fallen into the clutches of Trans-European Networks which have failed to take into account the detrimental effect of their activities on local inhabitants &apos; standard of living .
With air traffic booming and the new economy expanding rapidly , I can foresee a fresh increase in freight in the future.The Union must react and the Commission must propose tangible measures in response to the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens .
The entire transport policy needs to be revised in order to curb , or even reduce , air transport and related noise pollution .
No research has been carried out into noise pollution from airports .
It is essential to transfer short-haul air freight transport to the railways .
And personally , I am in favour of banning night flights in order to respect the local inhabitants &apos; need for a peaceful night &apos; s sleep , for they already have to put up with excessive noise all day long .
These three matters genuinely require urgent consideration .
Mr President , Commissioner , for some time the populations living close to Barajas Airport in Madrid have protested every time there has been an extension of the airport , for various reasons , but mainly because of noise pollution .
I imagine that other populations living near any airport in any large city will have the same problem .
I know that in the last two months the Government of Madrid has proposed a reduction in night flights , after 11.00 p.m. , but I also know that the measures that have been taken have not had any significant effect on the quality of life of the population .
Let us hope that it will improve .
Hence the opportunity for this debate , which we should thank Mr Lannoye for .
From the joint motion for a resolution , I would like to highlight some of the proposals - please excuse any repetition - which I believe the European Commission should take note of if it wants to reduce noise pollution : a global and integrated framework for reducing noise pollution which should lead to a framework directive with concrete and binding measures ; the uniform application of those measures in all Member States so that there are no distortions ; a Community framework for the classification of noise which will allow measures to be taken with the rigorous allocation of slots and a reduction in flights ; and progress towards the establishment of a common air space , which is not in conflict with local and regional measures .
In the fifth framework programme for research it would be necessary to carry out an investigation into the design of aircraft , with a view to reducing its influence on noise pollution .
We should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway .
In truth , Mr President , if everybody disliked aircraft as much as I do and travelled by rail as much as I do , perhaps we would have fewer problems .
All of this work should be done in conjunction with the populations and residents &apos; associations which are already pushing , throughout the whole of Europe , as in Spain , for a reduction in noise pollution , other types of pollution and a reduction in the enormous demand for air traffic .
We should also cooperate in the creation of a noise map in local areas which would lead finally to a serious piece of work on the part of the European Community in favour of a reduction in noise pollution which is increasing as a result of demand .
Mr President , I live 10 kilometres from Malpensa airport as the crow flies and I spent all my working life as part of an aircraft control team , and I therefore feel very strongly about this issue .
First of all , I must say that many of the problems are the result of bad planning or no planning at all .
The airports were built haphazardly and no practical assessment of the environmental impact was made as the towns , or certain parts of them , grew up around the airport structures .
Regional planning is only a recent introduction , whereas airports have existed for a long time.The first flights to operate from Malpensa , for example , began as early as 1910 .
Of course , there are other structures which are public nuisances - landfill waste sites , for example , which are created from old quarries with no planning - but , in the case of airports , we see the consequences every day , or rather we hear them , for they fill our ears rather than offending our eyes .
In addition , provision of information is poor .
For example , many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights .
Cargo flights generate neither more nor less noise than passenger flights .
The amount of noise depends exclusively on the type of aircraft , not on what is being transported : a cargo Boeing 747 produces much less noise than a passenger Boeing 727 .
Consequently , a thorough knowledge of the facts is necessary even for debating purposes .
Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated.Here , we have an example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity in its entirety , even extending beyond the European Union , for the standards are established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation , which is a supranational body .
I welcomed the Commission &apos; s remarks regarding a European legislative framework .
For example , as has already been said , we need to establish what is intended by the word &quot; night &quot; .Does night start at 10 p.m. or at midnight ?
Does it end at 5 a.m. or at 7 a.m. ?
This is something to be taken into consideration .
Another factor is the involvement of the local authorities , for every airport is different .
The noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used.For example , runway 25 of Fiumicino airport is next to the sea and hardly disturbs anybody at all , whereas if an aircraft were to take off from the right-hand section of runway 16 it would disturb half a million people or so from the Ostia and Fiumicino communities .
Local authority involvement is therefore important , although , I must stress , it needs to be within a general European legislative framework .
In my opinion , it would , on the whole , be feasible to eliminate night flights and ban them , although , I must stress , this must be done by taking specific local factors and also the type of aircraft used into consideration .
It should not make much difference whether an aircraft has a built-in silencer or whether its silencer is fitted subsequently : the engine noise can be measured and an assessment made of whether the aeroplane is excessively noisy or not , irrespective of the date of manufacture or the type of silencer used .
In any case , I would stress that we must not just concentrate on the individual factors in isolation but view the issue as a whole .
Mr President , noise pollution caused by aircraft is mainly a problem to those living near airports .
This is , in principle , a localised problem which should , as such , be solved by the competent authority of the relevant airport .
Different airports are already working on this by issuing flight bans to the noisiest aircraft or by banning certain night flights .
This solution , however , is not sufficient , since aircraft are produced on a global market .
Competition hinders such solutions , and creates the side-effect that more noise will be produced at other airports .
In short , we are simply shifting the problem .
Technically speaking , the problem is not that enormous .
By using state-of-the-art technology , it is possible to produce aircraft which generate six times less noise than aircraft thirty years ago .
Since the life-span of aircraft is about thirty years , the effect of these technical improvements are not felt for a long while .
The question is whether this long wait is desirable.I do not think so .
If we actually want to do something about aircraft noise , technical improvements will need to be implemented more quickly .
The extra cost involved will obviously be passed on to the user , who will pay more for their airline tickets .
The user should be fully aware of the actual costs of flying , including all environmental costs .
For the sake of fair competition , this should be done on a global scale .
The proposal from the resolution , which , among other things , presses for making information on the level of noise pollution around different airports available in a readily understood format , is a step in the right direction .
I also back the other proposals to reduce noise pollution .
It should be clear that , ideally , the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation .
Mr President , Commissioner , your comments this morning on both subjects showed that we need not only rapid data highways , but also efficient air transport in Europe to remain competitive .
It is obvious that this will lead , in our densely populated States , to increasing noise pollution for citizens .
I support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly .
I come from the region around the Cologne-Bonn airport , an extremely densely populated region .
We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens .
Every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport .
The airports of Liège and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km .
The companies are really not bothered about where they start and land their cargo planes , in particular .
For this reason , I would like to urgently request that we find joint solutions which achieve both objectives : a competitive airline industry in Europe and adequate noise protection for our citizens in the vicinity of airports .
However , I have surmised , Commissioner , from the Commission &apos; s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met .
Firstly , it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and , secondly , there is still no common method for monitoring basic data .
I therefore come to my request : you have proposed specific measures to the Commission in your report .
You have also set deadlines : the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment .
You have announced a strategy , which I welcome , for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data .
However , you have not set any deadline for this .
My request to the Commission is that , together with the regions , you set deadlines , in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected , which we can all work towards in a team effort .
Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this matter of night flights and , more generally , noise pollution from aircraft taking off and landing at airport complexes is an extremely sensitive issue and embraces several areas of concern which require attention .
This sensitive issue takes us back to a recurring problem faced by all decision makers and politicians , whether they are local , national or , nowadays , European , and that is the problem of how to reconcile economic development with the need to safeguard the health and the standard of living of our fellow citizens .
In effect , this embraces the three fields of technological , economic and regulatory considerations .
Although progress has unquestionably been made on the technological side , further progress is still essential in order to renew fleets of aircraft , particularly freight aircraft .
The European Union must continue with its endeavours in the areas of research and technological development , equip itself with the means it needs to produce the standards envisaged , and give financial and technological support to all studies and programmes which make shared information available and which facilitate the modernisation of equipment with a view to limiting environmental disamenities .
However , at the same time , we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue .
Airport complexes are hives of intense economic activity and appeal ; our intention to preserve jobs , reasserted in Lisbon , means that we do not have the right to avoid this issue .
Any use of existing structures and the establishment of new infrastructures must conform to the legal instruments - the area-specific land use plans and national and regional development rules .
Finally , in terms of regulation , in the absence of standardised European rules , strict harmonisation of air traffic control and restrictions must be achieved in order to prevent dumping within the Union , a phenomenon familiar to us , which is governed by decisions taken simply at local level .
We cannot allow this to continue .
The citizens are waiting for decisions to be implemented within the relatively near future .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to make a few brief comments with regard to our joint resolution .
We are discussing night flights , noise pollution and especially sleeping disorders .
As a researcher who has examined the social effects of industrial labour , especially shift work , for years , I appreciate - and this has also been adequately proven scientifically - the seriousness of sleeping disorders and lack of sleep .
Against this background , the entire discussion is relatively serious , bearing in mind Mrs Oomen-Ruijten &apos; s comments on &quot; the brink of the night &quot; and the way we are discussing noise pollution , and the lack of harmonisation .
In the foreseeable future , we will discuss at great length the more general aspects of aviation and the environment within the committee , including the common noise classification schedules , how to provide economic incentives in connection with noise and how to achieve aircraft noise standards .
However , one thing is still lacking from the discussion , namely that we will need the political courage to talk about restrictions , bans if necessary , for night flights during a certain period and reach common agreements on this .
Mr President , it is certainly not a coincidence that so many Belgian Members have taken the floor during this debate today .
The problem of night flights in a densely populated country such as Belgium is a very topical and extremely sensitive issue , especially since the Belgian Transport Minister issued a ban on night flights in Zaventem which , following a hefty row within the government , was withdrawn soon after .
I believe that Mrs Van Brempt has outlined the dilemma very expertly .
Tens of thousands of people live and sleep a stone &apos; s throw away from the runway .
15 % of the population are suffering as a result of the noise pollution generated by aircraft .
Medical reports have shown that people living near airports are having to deal with health problems of an unacceptably serious nature , such as insomnia , high blood pressure , stress and depression .
Needless to say , it makes no sense to ban night flights in one Member State alone .
Businesses , such as DHL , will then simply move to airports in other Member States .
As a result , we are at risk of finding ourselves in a downward spiral , where the citizens &apos; quality of life is pulled down with it .
Mr Sterckx has already pointed out , with good reason , that measures to reduce the effects for those living near airports should not promote distortion of competition .
The increase in the number of noisy , obsolete and unlisted Russian aircraft , in particular , is the cause of unacceptable noise pollution , not to mention the risks for the environment and safety which such aircraft pose .
In my town , Ostend , where the airport is situated in the centre of town , there have already been over 50 incidents , so far only leading to material damage .
I therefore concur with Mrs Oomen , who advocates uniform framework legislation , which will reconcile the economic and employment interests with the care for public health , the environment and safety and which will apply to all airports within Europe .
The much publicised and promised common framework for noise classification of aircraft could not be here soon enough , Commissioner , especially given the Russian situation .
I also hope that the European Commission will not budge one inch from the position it has adopted with regard to hushkits and will not succumb to American pressure .
Finally , I would like to ask that special attention be paid to the specific problems which smaller , regional airports have to contend with .
They are fighting to remain profitable and are even unable to make the necessary investments to reduce noise pollution .
This is why I would ask Europe , where possible , to help out in order to guarantee the viability of airports , but especially the quality of life of those living near them .
Mr President , I have taken careful note of all the comments made by the Members and I will pass them on to the Commissioner responsible for transport .
Parliament &apos; s message was very clear , as might have been expected , for most of the Members who spoke represent the interests of citizens who live very close to airports .
On the other hand , it was pointed out , and very rightly so , that airports represent major economic factors and that , if we start to impose bans , there is a serious danger that this will have adverse implications for employment .
Of course , the question which arises is how to reconcile economics with preserving the standard of living .
Clearly , the level of noise pollution from night flights varies from one airport to another , according to the topography of the areas and population density .
This is why , for the time being , the Commission is not going to place a blanket ban on these flights .
Moreover , very few airports in the Community impose a full curfew : Paris-Orly is the only one to impose a total ban on night flights .
Munich and Berlin-Tegel limit night operations to mail freight .
A general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities .
Most large airports place restrictions on the use of the noisiest types of aircraft or employ economic instruments in order to limit their use .
There are , effectively , a number of alternatives to banning night flights used by various airports , all compatible with Community legislation on market access .
A notable example is the use of a noise quota system such as that employed by the London airports , or a ban on using the noisiest runways during the night , which one very well-informed Member referred to .
In addition , the use of flight paths which generate less noise pollution , avoiding sensitive districts during take-off and landing , and the application of differentiated airport tax , calculated according to the environmental characteristics of the aircraft , are some of the solutions currently employed .
The question now arises of how to proceed in the future , and , most importantly , when to act .
Pages 34 and 35 of the communication on air transport and the environment contain an action plan setting forth a precise schedule .
I will not bore you with the details .
You have the documents in your possession .
The Commission has absolutely no intention of postponing decisions on this matter indefinitely .
It has committed itself to precise deadlines .
With regard to the regulatory framework , we aim to present it at the end of this year , or early next year at the very latest .
This harmonised framework could include common reference points for measuring the operational noise levels to be limited or prohibited , a provision allowing operators sufficient time to come into line with the new operational restrictions and the establishment of a right for people living near airports to request consultation and negotiations on noise reduction objectives .
The economic measures proposed also provide for differentiated treatment of airlines according to the characteristics of their aircraft .
In addition , the Commission envisages the development of a code of conduct based on current best practice .
I would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard .
The ICAO is currently working on drafting a new standard , and this is long overdue , for the present standards date from 1977 - ages ago .
Given the long life of an aircraft - thirty years - clearly , the effects of a new standard will only be seen in the long term .
This is why we are insisting on the fact that these new standards should be sufficiently ambitious to counteract the environmental effect of the fast-growing air industry .
In the short term , the Commission considers that rules stipulating the progressive , but rapid withdrawal of the oldest and noisiest aircraft are the best solution , especially for airports whose capacity is restricted by environmental constraints .
And the best way to ensure the environmental efficiency of these rules is to act at a worldwide level within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation , as the Commission is doing , in tandem with decision making at a purely European level .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , in principle , we should proceed to the vote .
It appears that the joint motion for a resolution is approved by all the political Groups .
There are therefore no complications and there are no amendments .
I would , however , like to request that the vote be deferred , if only out of a desire for consistency with this morning &apos; s events , and also because it would be fitting for a resolution as important as this to be voted in by more than 40 or 50 Members .
Mr Lannoye , I understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned .
You know very well that this motion is to be made either by 32 Members or by a group .
Are you moving this on behalf of your Group ?
Mr President , I am , of course , making this request on behalf of my Group .
In this case , Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure applies .
This means that one speaker in favour and one speaker against may take the floor in respect of Mr Lannoye &apos; s motion to adjourn the vote , and the majority here in the Chamber will then decide .
- ( PT ) Mr President , I would like to support this suggestion.I do not wish to be associated with the sabotage that was perpetrated today .
I think that the person who decided on this course of action should have said whatever he wanted to , but he ought to have allowed the sitting to continue normally .
He ought to show respect to his fellow Members such as myself , a Portuguese person , who will put up with a lot , but I am here to work .
I do not understand at all how , after what happened , this House can have chosen not to vote on the resolutions on Ethiopia , which are urgent , and have allowed itself to proceed to other votes .
I find this quite incomprehensible and I think that it makes this Parliament and us look ridiculous .
This is a matter which has extremely serious political repercussions !
This was the speaker against .
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favour of the motion ?
I am giving the floor to Mr Blokland .
Mr President , I would like to back Mr Lannoye &apos; s motion .
I think that if there are fewer than fifty Members in the Chamber , it is unfair to vote on such a significant issue .
This is why it is important that this Parliament make a clear statement , and a clear statement is only possible if a large majority of this Parliament is present , and not just fifty Members .
We have now had a speaker in favour and a speaker against .
We will now proceed to vote on Mr Lannoye &apos; s request to adjourn the vote on this item on the agenda .
( The request was rejected ) We shall now proceed to the vote .
Joint motion for a resolution on night flights and noise pollution in the vicinity of airports .
Mr President , various Members , such as Mr Beysen , who has disappeared and reappeared in the meantime , and Mrs Gebhardt , have already remarked that there are fewer Members in the Chamber than earlier this morning .
It is clear to us too that there are now even less than half of the Members here than there were earlier on .
The Members who have left are a mixture of Members who supported me in my request for a quorum and those who heavily protested against it .
It seems to me to be a good thing that this debate has got under way and I would like to extend warm thanks to the Members who supported me in this .
I also welcome the fact that , clearly , the choice is not about retaining or abolishing Fridays , but very much about improving the present situation .
Mrs Buitenweg , we are voting at the moment .
We will not enter into a debate on Friday sittings .
If you have a request on a point of order , I would ask you to submit it now , if not , I will now proceed to the vote .
Mr President , I accept the vote which has just been held and that a decision has been taken to vote now .
I would like to point out , however , that the voting will be by roll-call .
This is very important because it will then become clear how many Members were present and , more importantly , how many have left .
Ladies and gentlemen , we will now attempt to hold an orderly vote .
This seems to me to be in the interest of the good Rules of this House .
We are going by the Rules .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , I would like to say something about the Rules of Procedure which I think is very important given that the MEP , when she asked for a quorum , cited that it is her right under the Rules of Procedure .
That is correct , even though I do not approve of her behaviour politically .
But she has now said something which must be objected to in respect of the Rules of Procedure , namely that we will now see from the numbers how the importance of this vote is to be assessed .
I do not consider this acceptable .
Under our Rules of Procedure a vote is fully valid if it has materialised in a proper fashion , even if those who requested that the quorum be determined were no longer able to do this because there were no longer enough of them .
Even then a vote is fully valid .
Mr Posselt , you are absolutely right .
It is a fact that all votes are valid , irrespective of the number of those participating .
The legality of this vote is thus beyond dispute .
Mr President , we all have experience of trade union movements , national parliaments and so forth .
The reason for rules of procedure is that they guarantee democratic principles and obviously if , at some time , someone wishes to highlight a particular political problem , then they are perfectly within their rights to do so .
If , however , a right is somehow abused , I am not sure if that abuse has anything to do with democratic ethics .
I am speaking on a more general note here .
In other words I am not sure if , in the final analysis , it has more to do with being obstructive than with proving that there is indeed a genuine problem .
What causes me particular regret is that we all have experience of national parliaments and so on and this sort of abuse rarely takes place .
Mr President , I have already asked for the floor four times this morning in order to point out to those Members who expressed irritation at this morning &apos; s events that , ever since the first day of the new parliamentary term , we have requested more clarity regarding Fridays , i.e. to have either a proper meeting or no meeting at all .
I think that the problem could be solved very quickly if we could schedule the votes for the end of the session , like all the other days , and ask for everyone to sign the attendance register at the end of the day .
It would then become clear if we would be prepared to consider this a proper meeting or not .
I therefore recommend that this problem be raised in later proceedings so as solve this Friday problem once and for all .
Mr Meijer , I would thank you and other Members for their creativity in coming up with solutions to this problem .
This will not help us any further this morning .
All that remains for us to do this morning is to apply the Rules of Procedure in an honest and transparent way and , as such , I am at your service and at the service of the Rules of Procedure .
Needless to say , I will refer this morning &apos; s course of events to the President and the Bureau , upon which the competent parliamentary committee will deal with this matter further .
This is clear enough , I think .
I would now like to proceed with the discussion of the next item on the agenda , so that we can debate its content .
Let us move on to the next item .
The forestry sector after the December 1999 storms
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission :
( B5-0217 / 2000 ) by Mr Savary and Mrs Gebhardt , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the problems in the forestry sector following the storms in December 1999 ;
( B5-0219 / 2000 ) by Mr Daul , Mr Martin and Mr Redondo Jiménez , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
Mr President , I welcome this point of order , for foresters and the forestry sector cannot wait for the outcome of these rather irregular debates which can only have one effect today , and that is to send out a message proclaiming that the European Parliament is made up of absentee Members , whereas most of our fellow Members , including those here today , are certainly not relaxing in front of their televisions but are working in the field .
The issue is wider than that .
In reality , this is nothing more than a feature of the anti-Strasbourg sniping which has developed.Let us be completely clear about this and not try to pretend it is otherwise or to evade the issue .
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the forestry sector .
As it happens , we already expressed our sympathy , as we are wont to do , in a resolution of 20 January 2000 , and requested that the Commission supply us with certain information and undertake to help those of our citizens - and they were numerous - who were in difficulties , for this disaster affected the whole of Europe .
Now , four months later , we are sufficiently removed from events to be able to learn both from what has been done and what has not , and we are expecting a tangible response from the Commission to this question .
Did we actually intervene ?
Did we employ the means available to us ?
This time , we are not claiming appropriations for exceptional circumstances under the &quot; natural disasters &quot; heading .
The sector is simply assessing the extent of its difficulties and the resulting risks - economic risks , security risks , that is to say fire risks , and also risks of non-reforestation , for if it is not possible to remove the wood in the coming weeks , many foresters would prefer to leave them where they are , and then the forestry sector will be in permanent difficulties , and with it the primary processing industry .
Four months on , the purpose of this oral question is therefore , Commissioners , to inform you , first and foremost , that the condition of the forestry sector is critical .
In the space of two days , 193 million cubic metres of timber have flooded the market .
The first question is that of price control and regulation of the market , since the cost of removing some low-quality species is now more than the market is willing to pay .
We are familiar with the regulation of the market in the context of the common agricultural policy .
We are not asking you to include timber in that policy , but it appears that Europe could have employed equivalent measures to assist the timber market during this exceptional crisis.It could have temporarily regulated the timber market for a period of several months .
The question has been put to you .
What action are you going to take ?
Secondly , what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available ?
I refer to the means which allow us to grant exemptions from the competition laws to help exporters , for the cost of transportation of timber which has been exposed to fungal or parasite risk is totally unacceptable , provided that there is a buyer .
If we want to support the market , we must support the transportation necessary for export to places further afield .
Is the Commission prepared to take steps to do this ?
To what extent has it implemented Article 87 ( 2 ) of the Treaty , which allows it to grant exemptions ?
To what extent , if at all , has it approached the WTO to request it to grant derogations ?
What has it done to set up means of remedying the natural disasters affecting the forestry sector ?
These are not virtual instruments.We have rules , such as Article 30 of Regulation 1257 / 1999 .
If it has not done so , what action does it intend to take in the forthcoming weeks ?
The matter is urgent .
Finally , I call for the DOCUP development plans to give unequivocal consideration to the forestry sector and the timber industry .
Mr President , I would like to inform the honourable Member that the Commission is quite aware of the extensive problems caused by the hurricanes at the beginning of December 1999 in Denmark and Sweden and at the end of December 1999 in France and Germany , the devastating effect on the entire forestry industries of these countries and the implications for those employed in the industry .
May I refer you to Mr Barnier &apos; s speeches at the plenary sitting of 18 January 2000 , when he stressed that the Commission would willingly employ every available means to assist the Member States .
Nevertheless , with regard to forest damage , I must also remind you that the European Parliament , notably in its resolution of 31 January 1997 on the forestry strategy of the European Union , and also the Council of the European Union , have repeatedly stressed that the Treaty does not lay down any specific competence for a Union forestry policy .
Thus , the European Union does not have the necessary means to intervene in the way stipulated by the two resolutions .
In effect , timber is not among the products listed in Annex I of the Treaty.There is no legal framework and timber cannot therefore be governed by a specific market policy , even temporarily .
Although such actions are theoretically possible under WTO regulations , well-defined , solid legal , economic and commercial grounds would be necessary to persuade our trading partners to accept them .
To date , the Commission has not received a detailed analysis justifying its taking such a step .
I will come back to this point in a moment .
It is therefore , first and foremost , national aid to the timber industry which is the most appropriate means , at national , regional or local level , of supporting the worst affected forestry sites in the industry , and the Member States have to decide on the procedures for providing this aid .
The Commission is therefore currently assessing the national aid systems notified to it by the national governments for alleviating the effects of hurricanes on the forestry sector according to the effects on competition at European level .
The departments of the Commission are assessing these aid systems , particularly in the light of Article 87 ( 2b ) of the Treaty , which governs the compatibility of the aid envisaged by the Member States in the event of natural disasters .
The aid programmes notified by the French Government do , in fact , contain a general measure supporting the windfall transportation which may result in some of the timber being transported to countries outside the Union .
The Commission stresses that Article 87 , paragraph 2b of the Treaty does not constitute an exemption from GATT regulations as such , and we and our legal departments are assessing the compatibility of this measure with the Treaty on the basis of recent information .
The French authorities may be requested to provide further information .
With regard to the joint financing of aid programmes proposed by Member States under Article 30 of Regulation EC / 1257 / 99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund ( EAGGF ) , I would further stress that the Commission is prepared to be extremely flexible .
However , it is first of all up to the Member States to amend their initial programmes .
In the meantime , two Member States , including France , have presented their adapted programmes , which now include a substantial section on bolstering the forestry industry following the storms at the end of 1999 .
In this context , actions are proposed for the removal , storage , transportation , protection and replenishment of the devastated forests in order to support the sector .
These dossiers are currently under negotiation between the Commission and the Member States , but I can state here and now that the Commission &apos; s attitude is favourable .
I have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 42 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The vote will take place after the debate .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning .
You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission .
But Commissioner , I would also like , and I feel that this is essential , the institutions of the European Union to bear witness to the solidarity which unites the Member States , in particular in the event of exceptional disasters such as the storms of 26 December last which caused such unprecedented damage to a number of forest regions in France , Germany and Austria .
There is an urgent need for us to begin using the instruments available to the Union to assist the affected regions and support the individuals and companies concerned .
The need for our support is all the more pressing given that transportation , storage and forest exploitation cannot be delayed without serious consequences in terms of both the quality of the products and the restoration and protection of forest ecosystems .
Thus , in the Alsace region alone , more than 6.5 million cubic metres of woodland has been devastated , which is essentially equivalent to one to three years &apos; harvests .
Clearly , the influx of timber onto the market will send prices plummeting and so further damage the industry &apos; s economic operators .
Once again , the way that the sector is structured may facilitate the search for joint solutions between the upstream operators which manage forestry resources and the downstream operators which exploit them .
The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for , and development of , these joint solutions .
Indeed , since they are designed not to protect the interests of any one section of the industry , they facilitate the protection of the industry as a whole , promote the timber sector and ensure respect for the great internal balances which make it possible to consolidate the whole .
Although regional in scale , inter-trade bodies also have a local impact and are immediately efficacious in critical situations such as that of our forestry companies and the timber industry .
We should therefore favour direct contacts with potential partners , even more so given that inter-trade bodies are also the consultative partners of local governments and national authorities with regard to defining forestry policies and hence with regard to the search for immediate solutions to crises .
They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes .
This is why I ask you not to disregard direct consultation with the industry &apos; s operators in your consultation mechanism .
Moreover , regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question , as is , notably , the case with regard to grain storage , in respect of the impermeability of the ground , the water sampling limits , which are set at 5 % of the low water discharge in France and 30 % in Germany and waste disposal monitoring .
I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented .
The scale of the disaster shows that the aid pledged by the State or confirmed at local level will not be sufficient to cover the damage reported .
It is therefore essential to be able to draw on the Structural Funds to finance special measures for forests and the timber industry in the case of disasters in objective 2 or former objective 5b areas .
The same applies to rural development measures and other , more specific , economic or environmental programmes , in parallel with actions for using up workable timber , which represents about 50 % of the windfall .
It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production .
However , the urgency of the situation calls for flexible , simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States
I therefore call upon the Commission to seek consensus with the industry as a whole and the Member States concerned in order to find effective , immediate solutions , for the greater the consensus , the more effective the solutions will be .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I experienced the storms of Christmas day 1999 in my home city of Paris and only managed with extreme difficulty to return on the same day to Germany , where the forests were unrecognisable .
Further south-west , in France , my parents spent many days in the dim light of the petroleum lamp which I had given to them once as a present .
We do not know when and in what form the next disaster will strike .
Permit me , therefore , to say something about the current problems and to expand on one aspect of the comments of my fellow MEP and friend , Gilles Savary .
It concerns point 8 of the joint motion for a resolution in which we ask the Commission to create instruments which make it possible to take rapid and effective action within the European Union if we are faced with a crisis situation as a result of accidents or natural disasters .
We presently have neither the money nor the infrastructure for this .
We should not in future rely on cross-border neighbourly aid as in the case of the storms at the end of the year .
It was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner .
It is also a healthy and important expression of solidarity .
However , in itself it does not constitute a European solution .
The European Union must take full responsibility for its citizens .
The Commission must , therefore , quickly rack its brains to find instruments for rapid and effective emergency aid .
We will expect proposals for solutions soon .
We need have no qualms about making these proposals unconventional and bold .
There will certainly be no lack of support from the European Parliament .
The time has come to move on .
But first we must sort out the current consequences of the Christmas storms .
This involves three things in particular .
Firstly : we must not let the timber market collapse and must , therefore , directly intervene on behalf of the many small and medium-sized enterprises .
Secondly : we must , as an exception , also support necessary transportation and exports of valuable timber to third countries .
The Commission must urgently discuss the approval of export subsidies with the WTO .
Thirdly : we must do everything we can to counter the risks of fungus , pest and fire so that the damage does not become even worse .
Commissioner , when you say that national aid is the important thing now , then I would say to you that this also means that , in this instance , you do not want to organise the common European market .
Commissioner , Mr President , it is true that your news and your message are extremely disappointing when we think of the emotional concern shown at the damage caused by the storms last December .
Mr Barnier was very emphatic in his speech , assuring us that the European Union was , in effect , going to do something to help the victims .
By victims I mean the small-scale foresters who have been ruined , but I am also referring to the small seaside businesses who now have to face the influx of tourists .
Well , now we know that forests do not fall within the remit of the European Union .
So we are going to use part of the Structural Funds to finance emergency aid in the event of natural disasters .
Yet we are well aware that this will take time .
And , in this regard , may I say that the European Union &apos; s policy consists of robbing Peter to pay Paul .
We cannot support this policy , for it amounts to depriving some to provide for others , to the detriment of future projects .
In my opinion , this is really not good enough , and we expect tangible measures from the Commission .
The citizens are calling for immediate action .
Mr President , the document on the difficulties faced by the forestry sector following the storms in December 1999 only refers to the damage caused to the wooded areas in order to better illustrate the price drops in the timber sector and the implications for foresters and timber exporters .
The resolutions deal mainly with the regulation of the timber market and export subsidies .
For my part , I would like to speak up on behalf of forestry workers , who receive no mention at all , even though it is their efforts which are keeping the timber sector going .
The storms were more than just an environmental disaster for all of us and an economic problem for the profiteers of the timber sector .
They have resulted in a sharp deterioration in the working conditions of foresters and lumberjacks , whose jobs are extremely dangerous at the best of times with the very highest accident rate which will continue to rise .
The discomfort and danger involved in their profession is illustrated by the fact that there were over 100 casualties in the 1990 storms in Germany .
The forestry workers &apos; salary is shamefully low - a mere 6900 francs .
They are calling for a decent salary which offsets the risks involved in their job .
They are demanding to be able to retire at 55 and calling for an improvement in their working conditions , which are still antiquated and result in the physical deterioration and sometimes death of a number of workers each year .
We support these legitimate claims .
Mr President , in relation to the storms which occurred last December , the Community did not match up to our expectations during the initial emergency period and now it is late in fulfilling its promises of aid .
The Commission has a duty to learn the lessons of the storm disaster , and strengthen the effectiveness of Community texts .
Between the initial emergency period and the current challenges , with problems in the transportation , storage and sale of wood , there is a chronological gap corresponding to a gap in institutional support .
This must be remedied and the States concerned must be awarded logistical support in the follow-up to the initial emergency period .
In its resolution last January , Parliament asked the Commission to submit practical proposals if it were found that the funds available for aid were insufficient .
So what has become of these famous practical proposals ?
The Commission should use these proposals to prioritise its reaction to the slump in wood sales , for what we had feared is actually taking place , and it is becoming impossible to sell wood .
And what measures has the Commission taken or planned to promote the immediate cultivation of damaged plots of land , without which the effective reconstruction of our forests cannot begin .
Sadly , one merit of this ordeal is that it will have reminded us that wood is an industrial raw material , one that is , furthermore , essentially renewable .
The sustainable and efficient management of our forests requires an economically viable forest .
Similarly , only sustainable forestry can provide a proper foundation for a competitive wood industry , while making a crucial contribution to the development of rural areas .
The Member States are , and must continue to be , the main operators in forestry policy in Europe .
This must not , however , stop Europe pursuing the coordinated management of forestry issues .
The sometimes extremely binding regulations governing the single market apply to forestry products .
In return the Community must provide support for these products , especially at times of crisis .
Community action in favour of the forestry sector is appropriate inasmuch as it creates added value for the national action which has been undertaken .
This is an ideal justification for the principle of subsidiarity , for instance in matters of protection against atmospheric pollution and forest fires , or forestry certification , and also in matters of support for the implementation of a world convention on forests .
I support the Community initiatives in favour of the tropical forests , but I am astounded that there is not the same enthusiasm to come to the aid of our own devastated forests .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is now some three months since Hurricane Lothar caused devastating damage to forests in Europe , and in particular France and Baden-Württemberg .
In Baden-Württemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres .
This equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to 30 % lower timber prices .
Just the cost of remedying the damage in Baden-Württemberg , the area for which I can speak as the delegate , runs to about DM 1.5 billion , of which DM 300 million are needed simply for reforestation .
However , Hurricane Lothar is not a problem specific to Baden-Württemberg .
France and other EU States have also been greatly affected .
Nevertheless , the Commission has so far refused to make additional budgetary allocations available and prefers to cite , in this instance represented by Mrs Schreyer , the fact that final agreement has already been reached in the European Parliament on Budget 2000 and that the requirement for additional funds should be covered by the Member State in question from the funds already allocated .
However , the redistribution of funds was made subject to approval and this approval has not yet been given .
I consider the argumentation of Mrs Schreyer to be somewhat cynical when you consider that , only a few days later , she announced that the additional financial requirement of EUR 300 million for the EU Balkan commitment , which is undoubtedly important , would be covered by EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget without the farmers noticing it , and this includes forest owners .
I would like to stress once again that we are dealing here with extremely long-term damage which may also have ecological implications .
Tidying up , storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work .
Commissioner , I know what I am talking about .
I am a farmer .
I have seen how the hurricane took the roof off our stable and I have seen the state our private woods are in .
We were able to put things right ourselves but , by and large , this is not the case for all areas , all persons , all communities .
You can see that .
But that this is done quickly and efficiently and , above all , is sustained long term is an ecological necessity .
During his visit to the Black Forest on 16 February , the Commissioner for Agriculture , Rural Development and Fisheries , Dr Fischler , indicated broad flexibility within the existing financial framework for measures for rural development .
He indicated , as you have today , Commissioner , that you are willing to give consideration to , to help ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , the natural disaster which overtook European countries was tragic .
I am in complete agreement with the Members who have spoken on the matter and , believe me , the Commission would love to be able to do something about it .
Yet neither the Treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility .
As I said before , no Community framework exists which would allow the Commission to adopt initiatives to provide direct aid to the forestry sector .
Moreover , the same applies within the framework of Regulation 1257 / 99 .
It is the Member State itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid .
According to the principle of subsidiarity , the Commission cannot direct resources from the rural development programme towards channels supporting the timber industry following storm damage .
The Commission cannot apply competition regulations to authorise national aid or joint financing initiatives under the provisions of Regulation 1257 / 99 .
Moreover , negotiations are in progress with the Member States and I have made it quite clear that , within its institutional and legal capabilities , the Commission is doing everything in its power and more , and is being as flexible as it possibly can .
It is unfortunate that the institutional authorities have decided that forestry policy is to be governed by subsidiarity , and that it does not fall within the competences of the Commission but is wholly the responsibility of the Member States .
This is something which the Commission cannot change for the moment for that would mean amending the Treaty , although reform of the Treaties is currently being discussed .
I therefore call upon all Members who are convinced that subsidiarity should not apply to forestry issues but should be the remit of the Community to make representations to their national governments to this effect .
Commissioner , you have been extremely active this morning .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Joint motion for a resolution replacing the resolutions on the economic effects of the recent storms on the forestry sector in Europe
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Declarations of vote and other declarations
Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution and I am glad that those behind the sabotage which , from 9 o &apos; clock this morning , prevented us from carrying out our work properly and voting are no longer present to turn this Parliament into an undignified circus .
Imagine if other citizens were to go about their work in the same way as those delegates who think that they have a four-day week here , even though the five-day week for the plenary meeting was agreed in Strasbourg .
This Parliament has actually agreed , and I also say this to the delegates over there who want a democratic vote , that Friday will be a session day in Strasbourg .
It is indeed a strange concept of democracy , and this also applies to the others who instigated this circus , if the opponents of Strasbourg are now using genuinely dirty tricks to sabotage Fridays .
I was a Member of this Parliament 35 years ago and in all my time I have never seen such abuse of the Rules .
One really should expect delegates to respect a democratic decision reached by majority , such as that concerning our session calendar , even if it does not suit them .
But they are bad losers and they really do not care that they have prevented important resolutions being taken for the citizens of the EU and , in particular , those who are starving in Ethiopia .
This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible .
I hope that those who instigated this procedural circus will be punished by the voters .
In the interest of forest owners , including in my own State where , to be fair , the last storm disaster was not as devastating as here , for example , in Alsace , I hope that measures will be taken by the EU , as proposed here , in order , above all , to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises going under ....
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I would very quickly like to go back to the events which took place during the explanation of votes or during the point of order this morning .
I am very new to this Parliament and I would just like to express my deep disappointment at the incident .
Of course , I respect the Rules of Procedure and democracy , but the strategic , political action of a mere forty or so Members has prevented us from voting on Ethiopia .
On behalf of this Parliament , I would like to apologise to the people of Ethiopia , to the men , women and children who are suffering in a tragic situation and in relation to whom Parliament was prevented from adopting a position this morning .
I am extremely concerned .
We were able to vote on the last two items , which were also urgent , but , in all honesty , I would have preferred to have voted for the people of Ethiopia and to have lent them the support of this Parliament .
Once again , I apologise to the people of Ethiopia .
Mr President , I would like to support what Mr Daul has just said .
For me also the timber trade is something of great importance , but then our aid to Ethiopia is equally important .
For this reason I would like , and I attach great importance to this since you did not previously allow me to speak again when Mrs Buitenweg falsely quoted me , once more to clearly ask : where are those who this morning arranged this whole theatre ?
Why are they not here now at the end of the session , proving that the work of Parliament is genuinely important to them ?
That is the real question .
Mr President , like everyone else , I am deeply concerned about the situation we have landed up in .
I find it disagreeable to have taken part in the votes we have had when there are so few of us .
In actual fact , I abstained from voting in all our votes this afternoon because I did not think that I wanted to be involved and participate in making decisions which are as illegitimate as I believe they must be when there are so few of us .
I support the protest action which has been taken here today .
I am a new Member and therefore a little shocked when I hear that the unsatisfactory state of affairs which prevails on Fridays has been going on for years , unchanged .
If that is the case , vigorous protests are certainly needed so that we can bring about a change , for matters cannot continue like this .
We shall be a laughing stock throughout Europe .
I notice that , today , we are concluding this sitting with approximately fewer than 40 Members here to make decisions .
It is disgraceful .
Mr President , firstly , I voted in favour of the last motion and the amendments thereto .
That was the formal declaration of vote .
I would like to rid certain people here of the misconception that those who took the initiative for quorum counts are no longer present .
It is true that some have left .
But I am one of the people who took the initiative and I am still here , just as I am here every Friday .
I have noticed that some people say that there are people who are after a four-day week , but I am certainly not one of them .
I am , however , of the opinion , that we need to work a proper five-day week , which is not happening at the moment , if the number of MEPs in attendance today is anything to go by .
And this is why the problem has arisen .
If Fridays were like Tuesdays or Wednesdays , then it would not have been necessary to have this debate and the counts here today .
This will now have to be carried through to the moment at which Fridays either run in the normal way or , due to a lack of interest , they are abolished , which is once again a likely scenario .
- ( PT ) Mr President , I would firstly like to explain why I voted the way I did : I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution because I agree with the serious concerns and actions it puts forward , although this does not represent a change in my Group &apos; s position.Our position is that we have concerns about the Union &apos; s courts having responsibility for forestry policy .
Nor can I fail to mention the fact , which has already been referred to here , that the saboteurs of this morning &apos; s sitting did not take part in the vote , and I am delighted that the PPE has suggested a nominal vote , which will clarify the matter .
There is a French saying about the arroseur arrosé - the biter being bit.Here we have the saboteur saboté - the saboteur hoist with his own petard .
It is deplorable that we have been involved in this circus.Those concerned could have made a point of order , since it is an important issue that the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents have to address .
But they went too far.They showed no consideration for Ethiopia and sabotaged the votes .
They then suggested a nominal vote so a count could be taken .
As we can see , however , when we take a decision here on an issue related to storms , disasters or Europe &apos; s interests , that is , serious matters , they are no longer present .
Almost none of the 32 gladiators were present for the final vote , which is utterly deplorable and which clearly reveals the true intentions of those who destabilised this morning &apos; s sitting .
Mr President , I would like to say to Mr Daul and Mrs Lulling that , in debates on the Rules of Procedure , you must always bear in mind that there are also tactical and strategic aims coming into play .
It is no different for you than for those colleagues who tried what they did .
For the first time this morning I joined in the request for the quorum to be established .
I am a supporter of Strasbourg and a supporter of Fridays .
However , I am of the opinion that those who wish to ensure that the work of Parliament continues to be carried out should also be present .
I therefore thought to myself that a warning shot was in order ; what then happened I thought went too far and I did not want to fall into line because I thought that it was about Strasbourg and Fridays .
For that reason , I did not go along with it any further .
But the fact that those delegates did what they did you have to grant them .
You then have to respond accordingly .
The Rules of Procedure , and I would like to pay my respect to the President here , were sensibly interpreted this morning with great composure and great calm .
Matters proceeded as was established .
The votes which were carried out are proper votes .
They are no less valid because only a few delegates participated .
I consider that , by exhorting our colleagues , and also the Groups , to be present , we should try to rescue these Friday debates and these Friday votes and to bring about a positive outcome .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the President of this eventful sitting , the Members present and Mrs Reding .
Commissioner , with regard to the forestry issue , I would like to say that , although your openness has sometimes made your words difficult to accept , you have , at least , been frank , in contrast with those declarations made at the time of the incidents , which may have been rather rash .
I sincerely feel that your approach is far more beneficial to the credibility of the European Union than the tone of the declarations made when the issue first arose , which led us to believe that Europe was much more involved than it actually intended to be .
The subject of the forestry sector is now open to debate , and we must take up the issue of natural disasters as well , for we cannot endeavour to draw closer to our citizens and then explain to them that we are unable to help them when they are in trouble , while , at the same time , we are sending task forces abroad .
This is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance .
So thank you .
I would like to express my support for the comments of Mr Daul , who worked together with Evelyne Gebhardt to draft this resolution on the timber industry , and to express my regret and shock at the fact that we have exploited the plight of the people of Ethiopia to further our petty games .
Petty games which are not acknowledged , moreover , for although , effectively , the right does exist to request that the quorum be tested and also to bring up the issue of Friday working , it is blatantly obvious that this morning &apos; s events were an attack by the anti-Strasbourg faction .
And , even more seriously , it appears that this incident may well be repeated every Friday .
We do , however , have one small consolation in that it will not be long before their refusal to participate affects those who were conspicuous by their absence today and who managed to derail this morning &apos; s sitting .
We simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible .
It is a well-known fact , and I am publicly admitting it before all those here today , that the Chamber is never full because Parliament &apos; s work is specialised .
Nevertheless , we must stop trying to hide ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I would like to remind the House that , several months ago , Parliament rejected an amendment calling for Friday sittings during plenary sessions in Strasbourg to be abolished .
At the very least , one would expect Members to abide by their vote .
This amendment was rejected by a large majority .
Therefore , we cannot now make any changes to our practices for the year 2000 .
Finally , I would like to join the Members who have spoken in expressing my profound shame at the incident .
Parliament was prevented from voting to send aid to Ethiopia by petty political issues .
I feel truly ashamed .
Mr President , I , too , regret the actions which prevented this House from working this morning .
However , I welcome the fact that all those who have spoken before me also condemn the manoeuvres and they are the hardest-working Members of this Parliament .
I feel that we must be constructive in learning from this morning &apos; s events .
In the first place , we have a Treaty and positions of the European Parliament in favour of Friday morning sittings.We must enforce the Treaty and the European Parliament decisions .
I call upon Parliament &apos; s Bureau to charge the relevant Committee to examine the Rules of Procedure and any practices of the European Parliament which might penalise Friday morning meetings in Strasbourg , for we should , on the contrary , be making every endeavour to enhance their status .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate you on the way in which you have conducted this difficult session and I would just like to say something factual to my colleague , Mr Meijer .
I have been in this House for 21 years in all , although only 6 of those as a parliamentarian .
I have taken part in every Friday session for 21 years , even when I had another job and was not a delegate .
In this regard , I would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on Fridays .
However , irrespective of that , I would like to say that I have repeatedly seen such attempts over these 21 years .
For this reason we introduced a quorum for determining the quorum because we wanted to rescue Fridays .
That is how all this came about .
However , I would like to say to Mr Meijer that at some point it was also decided that we would pass legislative resolutions from Tuesday to Thursday and not on Fridays , for which the quorum is not prescribed as compulsory , when we would deal with issues which are not controversial so that resolutions which are not controversial , but important nevertheless , can be passed .
That was the consensus , and this consensus was reached here .
Perhaps it is a healthy shock and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is perhaps right .
But I would ask you to clearly understand that Friday was never intended for legislative resolutions.These resolutions are not legislative .
They are , however , important and they are consensual .
We should therefore be able to pass them peacefully and in a dignified manner , and that is why , at the end of the day , we have passed them peacefully and in a dignified manner .
Thank you , Mr Posselt .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 14 April 2000 .
Madam President , I would like to make a statement on this International Press Freedom Day on the situation in Tunisia and request that you intervene .
I will do so when you consider it to be appropriate .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
I have taken note of your proposal .
Madam President , I rise to speak on the same matter .
We have just learnt that the brother of Taoufik Ben Brik has been sentenced to three months in prison .
Everyone here realises that this decision makes the situation critical as the Tunisian journalist had announced his intention to continue his hunger strike until he died if his brother were imprisoned .
I have just read the piteous appeal that Taoufik &apos; s young brother has made to the Tunisian journalist to urge him nevertheless to end his hunger strike .
I therefore feel that the immediate future could be decisive in terms of reminding the Tunisian authorities of their responsibilities .
That is why I join my friend , Mr Barón Crespo , in urging you , as I did in a letter yesterday - and the situation has become even more urgent given recent events - to use your influence and your authority to obtain a fair and speedy solution to this tragic case of the violation of human rights and freedom of the press .
Madam President , I am going to raise a point of order in the literal and true sense of the word .
I am referring to the disarray in Parliament &apos; s calendars and agendas , at least for this current year .
For example , on 19 April , I received an e-mail from the Quaestor , Mr Richard Balfe , which stated that that day was a restricted day and that the meetings planned for that day were cancelled .
On 13 April , we had received a departmental note stipulating which days were holidays and which were not .
I would ask Parliament &apos; s competent bodies to plan and draw up timetables a year in advance , although I understand that unforeseen circumstances may require subsequent changes .
However , to change dates , as this departmental note indicates , to introduce holidays which did not exist before , is a serious lapse in planning in an institution with 600 MEPs and thousands of employees .
I would kindly request a little attention and organisation in relation to annual planning .
Mr Valdivielso de Cué , I promise you that I shall look into these matters very closely , but Mrs Banotti would like to take the floor to answer you in her capacity as quaestor .
Madame President , many colleagues have approached me about misunderstandings relating to signing-in yesterday .
I would just like to say that I propose to raise this matter with the Bureau this evening .
There was definitely a misunderstanding and many colleagues , in order to be here for the plenary today , had to leave home yesterday and incur the usual expenses .
So I hope we can raise this at the meeting of the Bureau later today .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti .
We will have the same situation on Whit Monday .
We will certainly have to keep a close eye on that .
Madam President , I wanted to take the opportunity to inform you and the other delegates of the fact that Mr Paul van Buitenen , the Commission official who , as you know , has played a not insignificant role in the uncovering of the previous Commission &apos; s failure , received a royal honour in the Netherlands last week .
I would like to add in all modesty that at least in the Netherlands , his work has always been - and still is - greatly appreciated .
Madam President , I want to mention the publication of a very important report a fortnight ago from the European Committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment .
The report is to the Spanish Government on the visit to Spain by the European Committee at the end of 1998 .
The report is accessible via the Internet , as is the Spanish Government &apos; s response .
A week ago , a Spanish Court sentenced five former government officials , including a Civil Guard general , to up to 71 years in prison .
The sentences ended the second so-called &quot; dirty war &quot; trial and added weight to allegations that a dirty war , sponsored by the former Socialist government of Filipe González , was waged in the early 1980s .
According to the international agencies , Associated Press and Reuters , two youngsters of 20 and 21 years of age were driven across the border into the Spanish Basque area where they were tortured for several days .
They were both killed by a gunshot to the head .
All seven defendants were absolved of charges of torture and belonging to an armed group .
The sister of one of the victims told reporters that it was shameful that they were not convicted of torture .
It is important to know about this matter .
Madam President , coming back to a point that was raised earlier on : 9 May is , as you know , Europe Day and Parliament will be closed .
There is , however , a meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market being held on that day .
Will members of the public be allowed to attend that meeting as observers or will they be barred from entering the Parliament ?
Thank you , Mr Miller .
The answer is yes : the public will be allowed to attend the meeting .
Madam President , when , on the last day of the last part-session in Strasbourg , it appeared on several occasions that we did not have the quorum required for voting , I suggested to the President of that sitting , Mr Wiebenga , that , from now on , we ought to carry out all the Friday votes at twelve noon or at the end of the sitting on Fridays , just like on the other days , and not get the attendance registers signed until the Members leave , with a note of the time of their departure .
Mr Wiebenga has announced that this matter will be referred to the President and the Bureau .
My question to you is : has the Bureau looked into this matter yet ?
I can tell you that I have indeed received Mr Wiebenga &apos; s letter and that this matter is on the agenda for tonight &apos; s meeting of the Bureau .
As you can see , we have not let the grass grow under our feet .
Mr Barón Crespo , I can tell you that following the letter written to me by Mr Wurtz , I have already drafted a letter to the Tunisian authorities , stating what you and Mr Wurtz wanted .
I think that this is the right time to make your statement , if you want , which we can then append to the letter to the Tunisian authorities .
Madam President , Tunisia is a country which has an association agreement and a very close relationship with the European Union .
Article 2 of that agreement establishes , by common agreement , the importance of respect for human rights and democratic principles .
However , since the beginning of April , we have witnessed a situation involving a hunger strike begun by a journalist , Mr Ben Brik , which is causing a serious crisis of conscience and a violation of the association agreement by the Tunisian Government.It has not only forbidden Ben Brik from writing as correspondent for the French newspaper La Croix , but it has also taken away his passport and prevented him from using the telephone .
I should also add that the Tunisian Government has hindered the work of those journalists trying to cover this situation and has treated them intolerably .
Therefore , Madam President , I believe that we should clearly point out to the Tunisian Government , which is a friendly government and is associated to us , that this behaviour is not only incompatible with our association agreement , but that also , as Mr Wurtz has rightly pointed out , that this situation should not be allowed to continue and is leading Ben Brik &apos; s relatives to endanger their own lives in defence of these rights .
Therefore , Madam President , I believe , given that there is no possibility of making sufficiently quick progress with parliamentary procedures , that this House should trust you to intervene on our behalf in order to put an end to this situation and to make the Tunisian Government see sense .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
It goes without saying that before this letter is sent to the Tunisian authorities , I shall discuss the matter with the Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb .
I did not indicate my request to speak earlier because one of the administrators of our Group had , before the sitting , already indicated to the President and Bureau that I wanted to table a point of order .
I do not know whether we will be able to include an item in the agenda for this part-session to the effect that we should be provided with information on the state of the euro , which is a cause for concern , or whether we should endeavour here and now to ensure that the issue is included in the agenda for the next Strasbourg part-session .
It was reported in the news this morning that the euro has already fallen below the psychological limit of 90 cents , which augurs even more worrying and serious falls in value .
We cannot continue to put up with a lame currency .
Somebody has to give an explanation and announce measures that can restore minimum levels of psychological confidence in what has now become the common currency of many of the Union &apos; s Member States .
I would like to draw the attention of the President and the Bureau to this point , so that our Group can , in good time , and if it should prove necessary , take steps aimed at altering the agenda for the next Strasbourg part-session .
I have also heard that , this morning , a Commissioner attended the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
Is the chairman of this committee in a position to provide information to the House on the Commission &apos; s views on such a critical situation ?
Thank you , Mr Ribeiro .
As you will be aware , we have tabled a debate on Mr Duisenberg &apos; s report for the next part-session in Strasbourg .
I think that this major debate will entirely meet your expectations .
Madam President , my Group intends to request that , in the debate on monetary policy , a Commission statement on the information policy that it is planning on the euro be added .
I would like to point out that we must not be influenced by information which is not only alarmist , but sometimes hasty , with regard to the euro , and that we must not focus solely on the progress of the euro &apos; s parity with other currencies , such as the dollar .
We must take account of the state of the European economy and also the possibilities created by the euro .
It seems to me that in this respect we should be as aggressive in our defence of the euro as our counterparts in the United States Congress are in defence of the dollar .
Madam President , I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Barón Crespo &apos; s last-but-one speech on Tunisia .
Furthermore , I am delighted to see that the Socialist Group has finally decided to adopt a rather more forthright position on Tunisia , a position that , moreover , goes far beyond the complex situation of Mr Ben Brik .
Nevertheless , Madam President , I did not understand your speech .
As you are proposing to write to the Tunisian authorities , an action I fully support , I feel that you should do so in order to state Parliament &apos; s position on the matter .
I therefore fail to see why you should append the position of one particular group to the letter .
You are quite right , Mr Dupuis , and that is why I said that I would immediately be discussing the matter with the Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb so that we can plan an approach which will be both forceful and well coordinated .
Withdrawal of Mr Le Pen &apos; s parliamentary mandate
Thank you , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , and thank you for having made yourself and your committee available to us .
Mr Gollnisch , pursuant to which rule do you wish to make a point of order ?
Madam President , I would like to speak pursuant to Rule 6 , in the first instance , and then , if you permit me , to Rule 7 ( 4 ) ( 2 ) , but I shall be brief and to the point.I think that this does , nevertheless , merit one and a half minute &apos; s explanation .
I think that you could allow me that much time .
In what will , I stress , be purely a point of order on the provisions of our Rules of Procedure , I should like to mention certain matters , which are not related to the crux of the issue , but which are related to the procedure to be followed in this case , which , I am sure you will all agree , is extremely serious .
First of all , I would like to refer to Rule 6 .
Rule 6 incorporates the provisions covering the waiver of parliamentary immunity into our Rules of Procedure .
I would simply point out to the House that , in the criminal proceedings that led the French government - wrongly , in my opinion , but that is not the issue here - to withdraw Mr Le Pen &apos; s mandate , in contravention of the French Penal Code , the courts made no request for Mr Le Pen &apos; s immunity to be withdrawn .
In my opinion , through its abusive interpretation of the idea of what constitutes a crime , this action is in violation of the protocol on the immunities granted to Parliament and of Rule 6 of our Rules of Procedure , which I invite you to read and note well , ladies and gentlemen .
You will see that it is a serious matter .
Secondly , Madam President , I would like to remind Mrs Palacio , in particular , although I am sure that she is familiar with them , of the provisions of Rule 7 ( 4 ) ( 2 ) .
This provision has recently been incorporated into our Rules of Procedure to cover precisely this type of case , following the precedent set by our colleague , Mr Tapie .
This is what Rule 7 states :
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr Gollnisch , You have exceeded your allocated speaking time .
You yourself said that you were asking for a minute and a half in which to make your point of order .
Mr Le Pen , who will be heard tomorrow in the Committee on Legal Affairs , will explain the whole case and we will do things in complete accordance with the regulations .
I really cannot let you speak any longer .
It is quite out of the question .
This is not the time to debate this matter , Mr Gollnisch .
Madam President , you have given the floor three times to Mr Barón Crespo , although these interventions were not tabled on the agenda .
I ask you to give me a few seconds in which to finish what I have to say .
( Mixed reactions )
If you have any respect for your position and for the rights of Members ...
I have the greatest respect for my position .
You yourself said that you were requesting a minute and a half in order to make your point of order .
That time is up .
Mr Le Pen will explain the entire matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs tomorrow .
Review of the financial perspective
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the review of the financial perspective .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me the floor to tell you about the Commission &apos; s decision concerning the review of the financial perspective .
Let me begin by taking this opportunity to inform you of another decision which the Commission took today .
The Commission today decided to appoint Mr Carlo Trojan Head of Delegation in Geneva as of 1 September this year and Mr O &apos; Sullivan Secretary-General as of 1 June this year .
Mr Levi , formerly Spokesman for the Commission , has been appointed Director of the Forward Studies Unit .
Mr Jonathan Faull , formerly Head of the Press and Communications Service , will henceforth - and for a transitional period - act as the Commission Spokesman .
All these staffing decisions were taken as part of the reform of the Commission and I think they were the right decisions in the context of the further reform measures that are needed .
The Commission thanked Mr Carlo Trojan sincerely for his activities .
May I add , speaking also as a former Berlin politician , that I too want to thank Mr Carlo Trojan most sincerely for the great commitment he demonstrated during the process of German unification .
Let me make it quite clear here that it was partly thanks to this commitment that the European Parliament and the Commission immediately rendered so much assistance to East Germany .
Madam President , I will now turn to the Commission &apos; s decision concerning the revision of the financial perspective .
That decision was necessary to secure financing for the new political priority , the new highly political task of providing assistance to the Western Balkans region .
Many of this Parliament &apos; s resolutions have emphasised how important the European Union &apos; s commitment to the Western Balkans is to the future success of the EU &apos; s foreign policy , and the Council has also constantly stressed its importance at various summits .
That is why now is the time to safeguard this task from the financial viewpoint .
In the financial perspective , the financial plan for the European Union , which the Council decided on in Berlin in March 1999 , the effects on the Balkans were not anticipated .
Let me remind you that the Berlin decision on Agenda 2000 was taken on exactly the same day as the outbreak of war in Kosovo .
When Parliament , jointly with the Council and the Commission , adopted the interinstitutional agreement on Agenda 2000 , the following statement was annexed to it at Parliament &apos; s instigation : &quot; In view of the development in the Balkan situation , particularly in Kosovo , the two arms of the budgetary authority request that the Commission , when needs have been ascertained and estimated , submit the necessary budget proposals , including , if appropriate , a proposal for a revision of the financial perspective &quot; .
On 16 December last year , at the time of the decision on the 2000 budget , the budgetary authority once again called upon the Commission to submit a multiannual financial plan for a programme of assistance for the Western Balkans and , if necessary , depending on the amount required , to submit concurrently a proposal on the review of the financial perspective .
The decisions the Commission has taken today are a response to the requests made by Parliament and the Council .
The starting point for the Commission &apos; s proposal is the following question : what resources will be required for the programme period - i.e. up to 2006 - to meet the substantial financial assistance needs of the Western Balkans ?
By the Western Balkans I mean Albania , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Croatia , Serbia and Montenegro , Kosovo , and also the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
We need to submit an integrated aid programme , while each country &apos; s participation in that programme will be conditional upon compliance with certain criteria concerning the development of democracy in the region , the rule of law and the will to cooperate .
The programme the Commission is proposing forms part of the stabilisation and association process and is designed to make financing available for the reconstruction and stabilisation of the region , for the promotion of democracy and the rule of law , the development of a market economy and the development of cooperation between the recipient countries themselves and also between them and the European Union .
Let me now give you a few figures , for whenever we discuss the budget we must , of course , quote actual figures .
According to the Commission &apos; s estimates , the financial requirement for Albania , Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Macedonia and also Montenegro up to the year 2006 will be EUR 1.5 billion , i.e. around EUR 200-230 million per year .
Late last year , we received a very precise study from the World Bank and the Commission regarding the financial requirements for reconstruction in Kosovo , a study which showed that , over the next three to four years , the financial assistance required will total USD 2.3 billion , and the Commission , i.e. the European Union , agreed to fund half that requirement from the EU budget , in other words approximately EUR 1.1 billion .
As I pointed out , the Commission proposal focuses particularly on the need for the regions to cooperate with one other , which is why special funding is to be provided to that end .
The Commission proposal also makes provision for including financial aid for Serbia to the tune of EUR 2.3 billion in the financial plan .
In this regard it is clear , of course , that these EU budget resources can , and must , only be allocated if there are signs of progress towards democracy in Serbia .
The Commission is convinced , however , that if we decide the financial framework at this stage , that will send an important political message to Serbia.It will make it clear that it is not just a question of making promises to the Serbian forces of opposition , but that preparations are also being made to provide immediate assistance on the ground once the necessary changes are in place .
With regard to the amounts involved , let me tell you the following : the Commission estimates the total requirement for the region at EUR 5.5 billion from the EU budget .
The financial plan in Agenda 2000 , which was adopted in Berlin , already includes some EUR 1.8 billion ; these resources were earmarked for Bosnia-Herzegovina .
Today , the Commission decided to propose reallocating a further EUR 1.4 billion of aid from other foreign policy budget lines to the Balkans .
It therefore proposed and decided to reprogramme the budget for external actions , as I will describe in more detail in a moment .
The view of the Commission is that we will have to raise the external action ceiling here for the next few years by EUR 300 billion a year .
In this connection , the Commission made the following proposal on financing this additional requirement : in the years 2001 and 2002 , these resources should be taken from resources previously earmarked for agricultural policy and reallocated to the external action heading .
I have already had an opportunity to discuss this proposal here in Parliament .
At this point let me repeat that this measure does not mean undoing the agricultural policy package decided in Berlin .
And it certainly does not mean curtailing the direct income subsidies for farmers .
Let me point out that , overall , the agriculture budget totals EUR 44 billion , which makes it clear that reallocating EUR 300 million has no impact on the overall agricultural package .
This amount will have to be financed in the year 2001 , among others , from the savings resulting from the euro-dollar exchange rate .
After all , the current exchange rate value of the euro means very substantial savings for the European budget with regard to export financing .
For 2003 onwards , the Commission proposes that the decision on financing the necessary resources should be taken in conjunction with the already scheduled mid-term review of agricultural policy .
Let me point out that the Commission is also proposing to the budgetary authority that the external action appropriations should only be increased once resources for Serbia can indeed be allocated .
This is therefore a decision that establishes a framework for the years to come .
In relation to the re-programming of external action appropriations to which I referred , let me summarise the situation as follows : the Commission proposals always took account of the geopolitical importance of each region .
We did not propose any cuts in programmes aimed specifically at combating poverty in the world and the proposals also took into account whether some programmes were not fully taken up in the past , i.e. the administrative activities and the relevant administration &apos; s implementation of these programmes in the areas concerned were examined .
The necessary redeployment is the result mainly of comparable cuts in the TACIS programme for the countries of the former Soviet Union .
But let me point out that , in relation to the Mediterranean region , the Commission proposal provides that in this coming period - i.e. up to 2006 - the resources available for the MEDA programme will be increased overall by 13 % compared with the previous period .
Let me conclude by pointing out the following : there is another point where the decision on the revision of the financial perspective also responds to a request by Parliament .
In connection with the 2000 Budget , you proposed that , in future , the appropriations allocated for Cyprus and Malta should no longer appear under the external action heading but be reclassified under the pre-accession aid budget , so as to make it clear that we have a coherent plan here ; that these are appropriations that will be spent with a view to the desired accession of Cyprus and Malta to the European Union .
I think that will make the financial planning even more transparent .
In many regards , today &apos; s Commission decisions satisfy some of Parliament &apos; s key requests ; we have complied with these requests .
That is why I ask you to support the Commission proposal on the review of the financial perspective and hope you will do precisely that !
Madam President , I thank the Commissioner for that report .
There were not a great many surprises in it and , to some extent , I welcome that .
A question remains , however , in relation to redeployment in Category 4 .
I heard you say there would not be cuts against the poverty lines .
You mentioned lines where there was not complete take-up and that there would be cuts in TACIS .
Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions ?
Last year , the Council proposed a 10 % across-the-board cut in Category 4 .
Is the Commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any across-the-board cuts in Category 4 ?
I am still unclear as to what happens from the year 2003 .
If you are taking money from Category 1 for the next two years , where do you expect that money to come from in 2003 ?
Mr Wynn , I can give you a definite answer to your first question as to whether the Commission is proposing across-the-board cuts in the external action heading : no , it does not propose to do so .
I would regard that as the wrong approach .
We have enough criteria according to which we can carefully assess to what extent we need to shift appropriations compared with Agenda 2000 .
So these proposals are entirely justified and no across-the-board cuts are being proposed .
On your second question : the Commission is proposing to shift appropriations from agricultural policy to foreign policy for the years 2001 and 2002.Let me repeat that this is simply a question of limiting the increase in foreign policy appropriations , i.e. not of cuts to the budget available today .
The Commission &apos; s proposal for the years from 2003 is as follows : we are looking to increase the amount for foreign policy , which , in arithmetical terms , would , of course , mean raising the overall ceiling .
But the Commission is proposing that both arms of the budgetary authority should try to make savings in particular areas during the annual budgetary procedure in order to find these 300 million .
It could also be that in connection with the mid-term review of Category 1 , scheduled for the year 2003 , it will be proposed that these additional appropriations be financed over the entire period .
Let me stress once again that , in my view , we can finance this increase in foreign policy resources within the overall ceiling decided in Berlin and that the appropriations for Serbia should only be disbursed once we see real democratic developments there .
Madam President , I was extremely interested and curious to hear what Commissioner Schreyer has just said .
I must say that we would have preferred to be presented with a written text , but it appears that these ideas have been the subject of internal debates within the Commission and that we will therefore be given a more specific text to study at our leisure .
Having said that , I fail to see your grounds for considering that agricultural expenditure is not going to be used in its entirety , as it should , nor how you could release sums , that you describe as minimal , for the heading covering international actions and foreign policy .
During the last financial year , we instead felt palpable tension regarding market expenditure and I do not understand what intellectual grounds you have for considering that too much money is being allocated to agriculture , apart from the fact that you need money for the foreign policy heading .
Secondly , the same applies to the cuts under heading 4 .
You tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity .
Fine , I can accept that , but what gives you the right - you spoke of very specific criteria , so tell us what they are - what gives you the right to think that too much money has been earmarked for other parts of the world , apart from the fact that you need that money for Kosovo .
I think that this is a genuine problem .
I will conclude with my third question .
I should like to know whether , in the undertakings concerning aid that we gave at the donor conference , we made commitments in US dollars or in euros ?
Given the state of the euro , I should like to know , if it was in US dollars , how you are dealing with the resulting situation and how you plan to guarantee that there will be strict parallelism between the donations made by the European Union and those made by other donors within the international community ?
Mr Bourlanges , to answer your last question , the World Bank &apos; s estimate of the requirements in Kosovo was indeed expressed in dollars .
We had an opportunity to go into this in depth during the 2000 budget discussions .
In its proposal the Commission has now allocated EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2000-2006 .
It is not therefore charging appropriations already disbursed for Kosovo in 1999 .
As for your comment that you need a written document in order to analyse the proposal : you will find the proposal on the financial perspective and re-programming on the Internet tomorrow .
The Commission will decide on the CARDS programme next week , because here there were still some questions that required clarification from the legal service.The key figures will therefore be available to you as from tomorrow .
In reply to what you said about agricultural expenditure , let me point out the following : this year , given the fluctuations in the exchange rates , we will be spending about EUR 500 million less on agriculture and the estimates for next year are that we will need about 650 million less , assuming a parity euro-dollar rate .
You are also aware that the Commission will have to make proposals again next year on various organisations of the market , especially the sugar market , and my colleague , Mr Fischler , has stated that he will make a proposal in this regard , which will lead to savings of EUR 300 million a year .
Of course , I am not saying that there is too much money floating around ; as Commissioner for the budget I am aware that money is always scarce , but money is also scarce for those who have to finance the European budget .
That is why , in my opinion , the Commission had to propose financing a new priority , without asking for new money , but rather by examining the possibilities of redeployment within the budget and making the appropriate proposal.And that is what it has done .
Madam President , you came , Mrs Schreyer , to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , you presented your arguments there , and you were met with respect .
However , I would like to make one comment and then put a question to you .
You say there was an increase in the agricultural sector and that this increase would be curtailed .
The fact that the percentage rise is so high is a result of the cuts in appropriations that were decided earlier in Berlin .
In fact , these appropriations are urgently needed !
I think we must not give the impression that we can keep using the agriculture budget as a kind of bottomless pit whenever we are short of money in other areas .
That is why I now ask you : do we not need to shift appropriations that might not be needed in export policy to the line for the integrated development of rural areas ?
We need substantial funds there , because enlargement , with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries , will generate enormous problems in these rural areas .
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , I fully and wholeheartedly support your commitment to the development of rural areas .
And that will also be very , very clearly reflected in the proposal I will be submitting to the Commission next week for Budget 2001 .
It proposes that next year we increase the appropriations to assist rural areas by 10 % compared with this year , and that will quite clearly constitute the largest increase in the draft budget .
I can assure you that the Commission did not approach the question of how to finance this new priority , this new task , by looking for some kind of bottomless pit ; it simply took a very practical decision for the years 2001 and 2002 .
Madam President , first I would like to express my deepest regret that we are debating a review of the financial perspective , and we have not even been presented with an initial written document .
If an issue like this is presented to Parliament , I would have thought that we might have had something in black and white , so we would know what we were talking about .
First of all , I would like to say that , not only are we faced with this bad example of administration , but that the Commission seems to take the view that wars can be waged and expenses incurred , yet the financial perspective cannot be reviewed .
The only way we can bear the costs of war and its consequences would seem to be at the expense of agriculture .
I would ask the Commissioner how this Commission proposal fits in with the decision of Parliament on next year &apos; s guidelines that agriculture could not be the primary source of financing , as it appears that more would be taken out of agriculture than found , for example , by means of reallocation .
On the other hand , I would ask whether the Commission believes it would again be possible to use the flexibility instrument for this financing measure , since the rules forbid the use of the flexibility instrument more than once ?
Mr Virrankoski , on your question whether the Commission is taking account in its proposal of Parliament &apos; s decision that the resources needed for assistance to the Western Balkans should not come primarily from the agriculture budget , we have indeed taken that decision into account .
Let me perhaps give you a few very rough figures once again : we estimate the need at EUR 5.5 billion and , overall , 3.3 billion of that will come from the external action heading .
So it is quite clear that the redeployment here is concentrated on foreign policy .
In practice , the Commission proposal means redeploying EUR 600 million from agriculture policy for the years 2001 and 2002 .
The second point is the use of the flexibility reserve .
The interinstitutional agreement provides that the flexibility reserve can only ever be used for a given purpose for one year , i.e. cannot be used on a continuous basis for a long-term measure .
The Commission proposes that , for the time being , only the EUR 40 million that are also available in the budget this year should be allocated to Serbia for the year 2001 , for example , to finance the Energy for Democracy programme .
In the event of a political change in Serbia during 2001 , we could also resort to the flexibility reserve .
Regarding your question of when the documents will be available , you will find them on the Internet tomorrow morning .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for her report , although a number of points seemed very unclear and could even be described as highly ambiguous .
If I am not mistaken , the total appropriations for Serbia are EUR 2.3 billion .
These appropriations are not purely nominal ; it is simply that they will remain on paper for as long as the Milosevic Government is in power .
This is neither the time nor the place for me to criticise this government , but I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission took into account the fact that neighbouring countries , as well as the Serbian civilian population , were being penalised when it decided to defer appropriations on purely political grounds .
Without direct appropriations and aid , how does it intend to resolve the issues of industrial pollution , the navigability of the Danube and the Danube &apos; s bridges destroyed by American bombing , which drastically reduced the river traffic of as many as five neighbouring countries ?
What contribution is the Commission going to make - not in three years &apos; time but in the next few months - to resolving the issue of the vast amount of pollution caused by the bombing of the Pancevo petrochemical plant , which contaminated huge areas , seeds and harvests with poisonous gases and which , according to the latest United Nations report , even polluted the water tables with dioxins , mercury and other toxic substances ?
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether there is any chance , any prospect of taking direct , immediate action on Serbian territory as well , in the interests , and I stress this point , of the neighbouring countries and regions .
Mr Manisco , the Commission regards it as most important to promote cooperation between the states and the regions with funds from the European budget , with your help .
That is why the proposal on the review of the financial perspective specifically earmarks approximately EUR 80-90 million for cooperation projects .
Secondly , as I pointed out , we have allocated EUR 40 million for aid to Serbia in this year &apos; s budget as well , but these funds will only be used in a targeted manner in areas where the democratic opposition forces are currently endeavouring to establish a democratic system and the rule of law .
This year &apos; s budget includes EUR 540 million for the region as a whole .
At the donor conference on the Stability Pact , Mr Patten approved certain projects and made it clear that the Commission can provide practical measures of assistance on the ground .
These EUR 540 million are available in the budget , thanks largely to the very strong support of the European Parliament and its endeavour to genuinely allocate adequate resources to this task .
In this connection , let me once again thank the European Parliament for making such an effort to ensure that the necessary funds are available in the 2000 Budget .
Madam President , Commissioner , I can be brief because , in the end , all the questions have been along the same lines .
We have heard that the figure of EUR 1.8 billion was decided on in Berlin.Today , as you said , EUR 1.4 billion has been decided on , and we keep hearing about the EUR 300 million reallocated from the agriculture budget , i.e. the 2001-2002 agricultural sector .
Commissioner , you had the opportunity to tell us about this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , but my question is quite simply this : how do I then explain why the farming community is so agitated ?
When you state here today that we are saving a great deal of money thanks to the exchange rate mechanisms , when you and Commissioner Fischler say at the same time that we can save money in the organisation of the sugar market , then surely the reason the farming community is agitated must be that this information has not been properly conveyed to them , that the agricultural associations did not understand it properly !
Or must we always and , on principle , begin with an exchange of blows when it comes to politics ?
I would therefore be very happy if we really could allay the concerns of farmers ; at the moment , however , that does not seem to be the case !
Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert , let me assure you that I have worked very hard with agricultural associations and lobbies over the course of the last few weeks to discuss and explain the Commission &apos; s proposal .
As I have announced , I will be submitting the budget 2001 proposal to the Commission next week.This will clarify the fact that there will be a sharp increase in agricultural appropriations , in line with the decisions taken in Berlin .
I therefore believe that , based on the actual figures , we can make it clear that the farming community need have no fears and that the important decisions taken in Berlin , particularly in relation to direct income subsidies for farmers , are not affected by the Commission &apos; s decision .
This item is closed .
Vote
- ( NL ) Mr President , I can advise you how to vote on each of the four amendments .
As rapporteur , I have no choice but to oppose these amendments because each of them has also been discussed and subsequently rejected within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
As such , I would suggest voting against the amendments .
Thank you for that clarification .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Pesälä report ( A5-0081 / 2000 )
Mr President , your suggestion of pausing to listen to the interesting explanations of votes is not being heeded , but I am , nevertheless , pleased .
I voted for the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products because I am convinced that it represents a positive technical step .
We cannot deny the Commission the chance to intervene in such highly technical matters .
I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity afforded by the explanation of vote to remind the House that there is a need for Parliament and the Council to make radical changes to the legislation on milk quotas as well as to the legislation governing the distribution of agricultural produce , regulated within the European Community , in terms of the quantity produced and how it is marketed .
The milk quota system was full of holes and we need a new one !
Maat report ( A5-0074 / 2000 )
Mr President , I am sorry that I am only giving two explanations of vote on this occasion , but I do so with great pleasure , for Mr Maat &apos; s report is of great significance : as we are all aware , it has ensured that the practice of giving free milk and milk products to school children will be continued .
I remember the time when an elderly person came into my father &apos; s bar , where I worked when I was a child , and asked for a glass of milk , saying , &apos; I drank milk when I was born and I want to die drinking milk ! &apos; .
I therefore put it to you - and I voted for the motion - that the European Union should give a glass of milk to pensioners , as well as to students , on a daily basis .
. ( FR ) I do not need to remind you how hard we had to fight to maintain the necessary funds for supplying milk to schools .
In April 1999 , the draft budget submitted by the European Commission provided for a 50 % reduction in that budget line !
That reduction made it clear that this financial assistance would eventually disappear , which provoked intense reactions within the European Parliament and elsewhere .
According to experts and specialists in child nutrition , milk is indeed essential to the proper intellectual and physical development of children , of all children .
Therefore , children of poorer families , who do not have access to certain milk products having essential nutritional benefits , can make up the shortfall thanks to the meals offered in their school canteens .
A proposal such as this represented a threat to the health of our children .
This was unacceptable , given that public health had been enshrined in the new Title XIII of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Furthermore , it totally contradicted the conclusions of the Agriculture Council of 14 and 15 June 1999 .
Our Ministers had stressed the importance of encouraging milk consumption because of its high nutritional value , especially for children and young people .
It was only after long , intense discussions that the Commission proposed to increase the budget line by EUR 31 million , with the total amount committed to aid for providing schools with milk then rising to EUR 84 million .
This is the situation in 2000 .
For the future , the European Commission has proposed to implement a cofinancing system .
A maximum of 50 % of subsidies for the provision of milk to schools would be financed by the European Union , with the Member States remaining responsible for the other half .
This is an unacceptable proposal !
It was obvious that the Commission &apos; s long-term intention was to dismantle the system of aid for supplying milk to schools .
The European Parliament &apos; s proposal , which I wholeheartedly support , is to make the Community pay 95 % of the cost of European subsidies for milk supplied to schools .
This is the only way to ensure that this system survives .
I also welcome the decision to also include drinking yoghurt and milk-based beverages in the regulation .
This must be done to take account of changes in habits and food preferences and to make this programme more attractive to consumers .
I can , today , express my satisfaction at having committed myself to this fight and at seeing that the countless letters to the relevant ministers , the countless questions to the European Commission and the countless press releases have paid off !
.
( FR ) This issue of Community subsidies for supplying milk to schools goes back to 1997 and is generating an increasing amount of interest in each of our Member States , all the more so because it involves issues of public health and economics , issues which are of concern to the European public .
If you need proof of this , you only have to read the countless letters which were sent to us when it became known that the European Commission wanted to end this programme !
That is why I can only urge you to follow the recommendation of our rapporteur , who is seeking not only to maintain this type of programme , but who is also taking a stand against the proposal of 50-50 cofinancing that the European Commission is putting forward .
Such a harsh cofinancing programme could lead to certain Member States refusing to pay their national contribution , thereby leading to discrimination within the Union .
Without denying the need to improve the management of this budget line , I nevertheless feel that improvements to the system can , and must , be made gradually , and I therefore urge you to support the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur by adopting this report .
.
( PT ) We are in favour of this report because we think it is important that millions of children attending schools in the European Union continue to be given milk subsidised at a rate of 95 % by the European Union .
As you will be aware , EC subsidies for supplying milk to schools were introduced as early as 1977 .
In 1999 , however , the Commission felt that it should put a stop to this programme .
But following considerable opposition , particularly in the European Parliament , the Commission submitted a new proposal , which , whilst maintaining the programme , would reduce Community cofinancing to 50 % , with the intention that Member States would finance , wholly or partially , the remaining 50 % .
To date , this system has provided for Community financing equal to 95 % of the target price of milk , and in the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , the rapporteur proposes that this level of financing should be maintained , rejecting the proposal of 50 % .
We consider this to be very important , as we reject the idea of transferring the costs of the CAP back to national governments .
- ( SV ) We have voted against the Maat report which concerns subsidies for the EU &apos; s school milk programme .
In many schools around Europe , milk is provided free of charge to the pupils in order to meet their need for different forms of nutrition .
We are wholeheartedly in favour of children and young people being offered milk , and even food , in school , as they are in Sweden .
However , we do not think that it should be the job of the European Union to subsidise school milk .
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , school milk subsidies should be reduced to zero .
We therefore view the Commission &apos; s proposal concerning cofinancing as a step in the right direction .
Since the 1950s , Swedish schools have provided pupils with milk and school dinners .
They have been able to do this without subsidies from the EU .
Sweden &apos; s membership of the EU means that Sweden , too , was informed about the common school milk programme and , today , Sweden consumes approximately one tenth of the common budget for school milk .
For some years now , Sweden has been providing full cream milk instead of semi-skimmed milk , simply in order to meet the requirements for milk subsidies .
This clearly highlights the drawback of the system , as well as the fact that many countries which presently make use of the subsidies really have no requirement for additional resources .
We believe that export and production subsidies under the common agricultural policy must be abolished .
Agriculture ought to be placed on an equal footing with other branches of the food industry and compete in a free market .
Europe is now facing a series of challenges requiring more money to be invested .
The money which is , at present , being spent on agricultural policy , ought instead to be invested in the reconstruction of Kosovo , the enlargement of the Union to include Central and Eastern Europe and aid to the Third World .
.
The reason for this intervention is to clarify why this House should oppose the Commission &apos; s proposals to cut subsidies for school milk by half .
I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this House rejected these proposals by bringing forward these amendments not to cut the subsidies at all and I urge everyone to support these amendments .
There are several arguments for doing so .
By nourishing our schoolchildren we also support our dairy farmers who need our support .
But also we are preventing surpluses like those seen in the past .
Trans-European networks ( 1998 Annual Report )
The next item is the report ( A5-0076 / 2000 ) by Mr Hatzidakis , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the report from the Commission to the Council &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 410 - C5-0010 / 2000 - 2000 / 2004 ( COS ) &#93; , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions : Trans-European Networks 1998 Annual Report pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation ( EC ) No 2236 / 95 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European Networks .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the ELDR Group supports the Hatzidakis report .
Community policy in the field of trans-European networks is of major importance because it is not possible to have a common transport policy without a convergent infrastructures policy , as is stressed in the Maastricht Treaty .
Efficient transport infrastructures are essential for economic growth and employment , as they are for the competitiveness of companies which depend on the movement of persons , goods and resources .
According to this debate , Europe , first and foremost , is that political Europe towards which we are striving , but it is also the result of economic and social cohesion .
It is true that the European Union &apos; s budgetary resources are insufficient and need to be increased , and it is also true that we need to increase the contributions of public bodies as well as public / private partnerships .
In this regard , my Group has drawn the Commission &apos; s attention to the fact that the report does not contain information on sources of funding other than the Community budget and the European Investment Bank , and it has also stressed its concern that as many as seven Essen projects have not been given a guarantee that they will be completed within the timeframes envisaged .
We , too , say &apos; Yes &apos; to the Brenner Pass and we , too , say &apos; Yes &apos; to the use of new technologies .
However , the Member States must respect the pledges made , and the Commission must also take into account the guidelines established for the B5-700 budget line - a major budget line established in 1998 - promoting more environmentally friendly models and , above all , taking the different factors into consideration where a trans-European link passes through densely populated areas or highly industrialised regions .
For this reason , we also consider that appropriations set aside for these projects must not exceed 50 % and that , after due analysis , the amounts still available for projects on which little progress has been made could be recouped and used for other projects with the same priorities , including environmental priorities .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as the two rapporteurs , Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs Sbarbati , have already explained , both the competent committee and the Committee on Budgets wholeheartedly endorsed the Brenner project , a project that came at the top of the Essen list of priorities .
However , the original project did not set out a list of priorities , a major shortcoming .
I therefore consider it essential for the Commission to accept the points laid down in this report , and which have been explained by the rapporteur , as they stand .
The Brenner Pass covers a region that includes three countries and , as such , it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention .
At present , 1.2 million lorries cross the Brenner Pass every year .
The growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase .
The free movement of persons , one of the freedoms in the European Union , cannot be achieved properly either .
Good Friday saw extremely lengthy tailbacks on the Brenner Pass .
We , Mr Jarzembowski , Mr Swoboda and I - as pointed out in the explanatory statement of this motion in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism - tabled a motion in which we justified this initiative as being a means of achieving an innovative model and approach to project development .
It breaks new ground and can set an example to the European Union .
Under the Prodi government , the Italian legislature had already considered the possibility of cross-financing road - i.e. road tolls - and rail transport and indeed approved it .
I believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach .
That is an absolute must , especially in an environmentally sensitive area , and I hope the Commission will exhibit the necessary sensitivity .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first let me congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Hatzidakis , on his very sound report .
The report is as good and judicious as Mr Hatzidakis is in his chairmanship of the committee , for which he certainly deserves recognition and thanks .
Let me also take this opportunity to support him when he says that the financial resources for developing the trans-European networks are no longer adequate .
He proposes increasing the budget funding .
According to Commissioner Schreyer today , that will not be very easy to achieve .
That is why Mr Hatzidakis quite rightly proposed in committee that funding should also be procured from private or other semi-public institutions .
The previous Commissioner , Mr Kinnock , put forward several ideas on the subject on the basis of the activities of a working party and I hope Mrs Schreyer will be able to develop and take up some of these ideas , for without an incentive system of extra funding from the private sector too , we will not succeed in achieving what Mr Hatzidakis , the committee and , I hope , Parliament too , will propose tomorrow .
It is quite clear that in view of the additional tasks that we are also confronted with in transport , when we think of Eastern Europe and the candidate countries , it will not be possible to achieve what Mr Ebner has just called for , namely redeployment from road to rail , especially in bottleneck areas .
That is not an anti-roads policy , because it will , of course , free up the roads for the kind of transport best suited to them .
That is why we need this redeployment .
Some successes have been achieved , especially in relation to the agreement with Switzerland ; in other areas , however , we have been less successful .
Let me also say a few words on the Brenner base-level tunnel.The European Commission has already financed the feasibility study , in fact financed it more heavily than other projects .
Studies alone , however , are not enough .
That is why we do not yet have any additional mode of transport , why no fewer cars are being driven and why we are not seeing a switch to rail transport .
That is why we must tackle the projects and why we need investment .
We also tabled a motion to this effect on account of our common concern in committee .
The three governments concerned and the Commission really must act now , begin with the spadework and start building , while , of course , at the same time guaranteeing the necessary funding .
I believe the Brenner base-level project is one of the most important European projects that need tackling , with a view to making north-south traffic environment-friendly and efficient .
If we combine that with the additional measures concerning the candidate countries , then , in five to ten years &apos; time , we could see an efficient transport system in Europe , and that is something we urgently need !
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Hatzidakis , for his excellent report .
The rapporteur has gone into the matter with great care and raised some very important issues .
Our Group supports him , for example , on the issue of coordinating regional and private funding in the Member States of the Union .
However , I would like to underline a few issues .
The annual report shows that shortcomings exist in the way money spent on the development of trans-European networks is monitored , and insufficient details are available as to the results achieved through the use of funds .
We need more precise accounts of inter alia how the European Regional Development Fund , the Cohesion Fund , funds from financial sources not included in the Union budget and funds from the Member States are spent to improve trans-European transport networks .
We also need a report on the effects of functional transport networks on a sustainable economy and employment .
The rapporteur has quite rightly pointed out that , of the fourteen Essen specific projects , seven still require confirmation of their funding and timetables .
In addition , the Essen projects have devoured a larger proportion of the Union &apos; s funding for transport than was agreed .
In the future , greater care should be taken in selecting such specific projects .
At the same time , it must be ensured that the Member States will commit themselves to them , set aside a sufficiently large share of funding for them , and give them priority in their own plans .
The Annual Report shows that more money is also needed for the development of transport and traffic safety through the Union budget , since transport communications are so vital for the economy , employment and , furthermore , for social cohesion .
In the future we shall have to pay more attention to the coordination of various forms of transport .
At the same time , we shall also have to give consideration to the link between regional policy and transport .
Balanced regional development can help to slow down the trend towards centralisation and reduce traffic congestion .
In addition to addressing the problems of traffic in congested areas , we will also have to ensure that the trans-European networks are extended and that they are also developed in areas where the volume of traffic is lighter - areas where there is less traffic , remote areas , and areas where the physical environment presents greater problems .
Good communications are a vital necessity in these areas .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are agreed on one thing : policy on trans-European networks is in urgent need of reform !
The trans-European transport networks , and the 14 specific projects in particular , have not succeeded in any of the aims they were in fact intended to achieve , even though a great deal of money has already been invested .
But two of these aims really are vital to the European Union .
One is the key aim of economic and social cohesion , which holds the European Union together .
These TENs were designed to prevent the drifting apart , or the risk of a drift apart , between poor and affluent regions .
They have not done so .
On the contrary , the 14 selected projects have , in fact , driven the regions further apart , and have encouraged a trend towards increased economic activity in the prosperous economic regions , because transport links have been constructed between them , while the poorer regions have become increasingly isolated .
Secondly , it is still a mistake to think that the trans-European networks help reduce mass unemployment .
On the contrary , unemployment has risen : even in 1995 , in the ten poorest regions , unemployment was seven times higher than in the richest regions , while today it is eight times higher , and rising .
So I really wonder whether we can afford to continue putting European taxpayers &apos; money in concrete without this having a significant impact on employment .
Is there really any point in investing more money and calling for more money in this case ?
Is that not an incorrect response in structural terms , because we could do far more sensible things with the money in order to regenerate employment .
I also wonder whether the value of these projects has not been offset by the environmental destruction they cause .
In fact , they have achieved nothing .
They have destroyed much of the living space of the people of Europe and we should take the mass protest movements against motorways seriously , for they often point the way to more sensible and less destructive options .
Perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right .
Europe needs a considerably more intelligent and sustained transport policy , based on a modern approach that thinks ahead to the next generation , realising that resources are finite .
As regards the 14 projects , the European Parliament &apos; s call for a cost-benefit analysis was not heeded , whilst its call for environmental compatibility checks for all the projects was also ignored ; only partial checks were carried out , which conflicts with the relevant directive .
I think we really need to improve goods transport , which must be facilitated by rail in order to be sustainable .
We must revise the TENs policy with a view to combining mobility with sustainability .
Mr President , the trans-European networks are often hailed as one of the key successes of European integration .
This is true to some extent but they also make our society more vulnerable .
They help to strengthen the cohesion between the economies of the EU Member States .
Each country is becoming increasingly reliant on imported energy and a great deal of effort also goes into consultation and legal rulings .
What effect does this have on the people in Europe ?
Perhaps an increase in the number of jobs in the short term .
In the longer term , it could be that , quite unintentionally , businesses become more vulnerable owing to technical defects in a costly transport system and that jobs could , at short notice , be moved to areas with lower wages , poorer working conditions and fewer environmental requirements .
Nothing therefore to get too excited about for the time being .
Similarly , the major transport projects are not as promising as the annual report would like to suggest .
For the north-south high-speed link from Berlin to Verona , only a few minor components have been constructed .
In England , the connection of the high-speed link which runs through the Channel Tunnel has been in the doldrums for many years as a result of the privatisation and the splitting up of the railway companies in that country .
Spain has decided not to go ahead with a European standard gauge for the high-speed link between Madrid and Barcelona , which was used for the line from Madrid to Seville .
The construction of the Betuwe line through the Netherlands is becoming increasingly controversial .
Economic experts have calculated that this expensive line would never be a success .
The costs seem to increase daily , the inland shipping industry considers this line to be distorting competition , freight transport by road does not seem to have gone down as a result and environmental activists are thwarting activities on a daily basis .
All in all , a good enough reason to abandon the Betuwe line project .
There is still far too little broad-based , social debate on the priorities set and choices made .
The people of Europe are entitled to more information on the impact of the TENs , i.e. the impact on their livelihoods , the costs involved , environmental considerations and the rate of implementation .
Mr President , I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to colleague Hatzidakis for a very fine report to Parliament here this afternoon .
The Commission &apos; s 1998 annual report on trans-European transport networks gives a clear overall picture of the progress that has been made in certain specific projects as well as containing valuable information on the contributions made to these infrastructural projects by the various sources of Community funding .
Clearly , it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs .
At present , the funding is decidedly inadequate if we are to attempt seriously to meet the commitments entered into at the Essen European Summit in 1994 .
I share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen Essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation .
It would be useful if the Commission , in its future annual reports , specified what funding has been provided by national , regional and local public bodies and by the private sector , in addition to European funding , with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks .
The Commission will shortly undertake a revision of the TEN guidelines .
I hope that in these new guidelines they will accord greater importance to improving access to trans-European network funding for Europe &apos; s island and remote regions .
It is important to place particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable transport links with these disadvantaged regions if they are to share equally in the benefits of a unified single market .
If the revision of the TEN guidelines were to concentrate just on existing bottlenecks as announced by the Commission in its work programme for the year 2000 , this would focus the funding on the more economically developed central regions of the Union , perhaps to the detriment of the outermost regions .
A package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network .
The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis warmly , in particular because he has produced a genuinely realistic report , but some of his observations , which are rather disturbing , should be of particular concern to us .
It is worth remembering that the decisions that led to the choice of these 14 major projects date back to the Essen Summit , which took place in 1994 , that is , already six years ago now .
Six years on from that decision , only half of these projects have made any real progress , and those projects are , by and large , concentrated in the northern half of the continent .
A positive start has been made , but the situation looks pretty grim as regards the other projects and , in particular , for the remote regions , as Mr Collins has already pointed out .
I am particularly thinking of the Southern link , which is supposed to link France , in particular Lyon , together with Turin and Trieste , to the rest of the Balkans that we would like to see firmly annexed to Europe.I am also thinking of the other part of Europe , comprising of Austria , with its specific problems mentioned by other speakers , Hungary , and the other countries of central Europe .
In this context , I would remind you that it is not only about opening up a Piedmont which is hidden away , a Piedmont stuck in the Alps.This is about connecting a whole region of the continent , the Balkans and central Europe , to the southern part of Europe , to France , Italy , Spain and Portugal , and no real progress has been made as regards this project .
So , in response to what Mrs Schroedter said , I feel that we must not lose sight of the fact that what these major projects are mainly concerned with is the development of railway infrastructures .
This particularly applies to this southern axis , which would make Paris only three and a half hours distant from Milan .
There are , however , difficult choices to be made in order to avoid the huge pollution-related problems currently in the news in Austria , as well as in Italy and Germany .
Choices have to be made ; there must be investment and this decision , this choice that was made in Essen , is still no closer to being taken , six years down the line .
This concerns Member States , of course , and certainly Italy in particular , which has not supported this project with sufficient vigour , but it also concerns the Commission , as the rapporteur made very clear .
It is the Commission &apos; s duty to come up with measures which encourage both public authorities and private companies to invest in these huge trans-European networks .
I therefore consider it to be crucial that the Commission submits new proposals so that these dossiers , which are still deadlocked , can proceed as quickly as possible .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are serious problems with seven of the transport projects decided upon by the Essen Council .
Like the rapporteur , I am disturbed about this .
One of these projects is the extension of the north-south link , and in particular the Brenner base-level tunnel .
Through this project the European Union could demonstrate that it is not just paying lip service to the idea of shifting transit transport from road to rail .
This is an opportunity to reduce the environmental burden on the region concerned and its population .
Moreover , this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Union as a whole .
Unfortunately , however , there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation .
The subsidiary of the Austrian Brenner Railway Company and the Italian Railways , which is supposed to complete the project planning within a period of eighteen months , was only set up at the end of last year .
This means that , more than five years after Essen , there are still no concrete plans on the table .
The people of the region cannot understand that .
For it is they who have to live with the ever-growing avalanche of traffic .
The existing rules , under which a maximum of 10 % of the total investment can be funded by the Union , are quite simply inadequate and unfair for projects that have enormous implications for the future of the European economy as a whole .
Member States that will benefit from the completion of the Brenner base-level tunnel cannot shrug off their responsibility and leave it entirely to the countries directly concerned , like Germany , Austria and Italy , to shoulder the financial burden .
In the end , that kind of attitude has nothing to do with solidarity .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first let me very firmly reject Mrs Schroedter &apos; s across-the-board criticism of the TENs .
In fact she has insulted us as well , for Parliament and the Council adopted the 1996 guideline by codecision on a proposal from the Council .
If that was such a terrible thing , the Greens should have opposed it at the time .
They did not do so .
Let me just mention two projects that have been successful .
I think that , from the environmental standpoint , the rail link across the Øresund was precisely the right thing to do .
We want railways and we want links with remote regions .
The new Anglo-Irish rail links are of great benefit to the environment and the region .
The Greens are quite simply wrong to criticise the TENs as benefiting only the central and most densely populated states .
Secondly , I agree with Mr Ebner and others that , as far as the Brenner base-level tunnel is concerned , we have to think up some new ideas .
Our committee proposes a four-sided agreement between the three states concerned and the Union .
The Brenner base-level tunnel is an unusually large-scale project , and also a project with an unusually significant impact on the environment , for the Alps cannot be compared with the lowlands of the Netherlands or Friesland in Germany .
The environmental situation in the Alps is particularly problematic .
Quite simply , the way the noise and the stench of cars remains trapped in the valleys is quite different from conditions on flat ground .
Something therefore needs to be done in this regard .
Above all , we must persuade governments not to shift the blame onto each other .
The Italians say they will start building when the Austrians build .
The Germans say they will begin building once the Austrians are building .
The Austrians say they will start to build once the Germans and the Italians begin .
So we need clear yardsticks and data on who pays what and when , and the Community must make a serious effort to get this whole project going .
Let me make two final comments .
Madam Vice-President of the Commission.Take your time with the revision of the trans-European networks !
First , you should take another look at all the projects in the light of today &apos; s debate .
We do not want more show projects , 14 or 15 show projects , with no guaranteed financing .
In this revision , we should identify measures as priorities only if we are certain they can be financed over a period of 10-15 years .
For the citizens will lose confidence in us if we declare certain projects to be priorities and then do not execute them .
We must remind the Member States that they have committed themselves to guaranteeing the financing , committed themselves to executing the plan .
Then we really must take them at their word and say : we will only list specific projects if they really are ready to be executed and financed .
Take your time and reopen these difficult discussions with the Member States so that you , as the Commission , do not propose projects in which we make fools of ourselves in front of the citizens , but projects that are feasible !
Mr President , I shall try to speak more slowly this time because last time I gave the interpreters a hard time by speaking at a Mediterranean tempo .
I come from a country which , because of its geographical location , has major transport problems when it comes to sending goods or persons to and from European cities and markets and when it comes to giving and taking .
One can therefore quite easily understand the great interest this country and its representatives have in trans-European networks , which I wish to talk about today .
However , not only as Greeks , but primarily as Europeans , we cannot but treat these networks as an important tool in our endeavour to strengthen social and economic cohesion , employment and sustainable development in our struggle to achieve European integration.And , of course , I disagree with what Mrs Schroedter has just said .
We should indeed accord trans-European networks the real importance which they deserve .
We should ensure that the financial resources spent on TENs are increased .
What is more , allow me to say that we owe this increase since , in the last decade , the need to cut spending in view of the obligation to meet the criteria and objectives of Economic and Monetary Union also badly affected TEN funding .
We should speed up the implementation of these projects by improving procedures and facilitating their funding through flexible public and private sector partnerships .
We should see to it that we overcome any hurdles that are holding up 7 of the 14 Essen projects and leaving us exposed .
And , of course , we should attach importance during the revision of the TEN guidelines to access to island regions and to regions which have difficulty obtaining access to the sea .
The Commission has presented us in its 1998 annual report with a rough picture of the state of progress in the construction of these networks , a picture which the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism - which , in the report under discussion , is asking for greater efficiency in the whole network construction operation - would like to be more detailed and informative .
The main role in the whole of this extremely important operation for the future of Europe belongs to the Commission and we call on it , in collaboration with the Member States , to give absolute priority , in the full meaning and with all the implications of the word , to developing these main arteries in the body of Europe so that it can function in the way we all want it to and meet the expectations of European citizens .
In closing , I would like to thank and congratulate the chairman of the committee and rapporteur , my fellow countryman Konstantinos Hatzidakis , for the work which he has put into his report which , of course , should be adopted .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is common knowledge that , at regional level in the European Union , there is a close connection between low per capita income , high unemployment and distance from mainland Europe or geographical remoteness , which is currently a serious problem , but which has existed since the industrial revolution of the 19th century , due to underdeveloped communications .
This is a vicious circle , which can only be broken by a political and economic joint action which addresses all the issues that are causing this underdevelopment .
The trans-European networks policy is not , however , being implemented in such a way as to resolve this crucial issue , despite the fact that it was introduced with the specific aim of establishing direct links between remote countries and the Union &apos; s central regions .
The basic aim of the specific projects and budgets of the trans-European networks , as well as those financed by the Structural and Cohesion Funds , which resulted from a policy that was greatly desired by the Member States , yet poorly accepted and supported by the Commission , was to establish direct links between those regions that have a higher per capita income.In doing so , they rode roughshod over the regulations currently in force , with the damaging consequences with which we are all familiar .
The debate on the report by Mr Hatzidakis , whom I congratulate , provides us with a good opportunity to get to grips with the political dimension of the current situation and to try to find a solution to it , in line with the decisive reform of the trans-European networks policy which is due to be implemented in the 2000-2006 period .
It is therefore the intention of our political group , as the amendments that have been presented have highlighted , to ensure that the networks are compatible with sustainable development and that the reform corresponds to the objective of uniting the whole Community by prioritising the remote regions , which have hitherto been neglected .
Finally , it is our intention to upgrade the railways and to bring about the decentralisation of the networks , particularly with regard to airports and ports .
The concentration of road , airport and port networks is causing serious congestion and environmental problems which we must prevent .
I hope that we will be able to bring about the changes that the European Union needs in order to achieve the regional balance and social cohesion that we are advocating .
We must be aware that , at this precise moment , Regional Development Plans are being approved for the period 2000-2006 which will contribute to isolating even further the Objective 1 regions , which desperately need a modern connection to the whole of Europe , including high speed rail links .
Amongst these regions are my own country , Galicia , and the entire north-western Iberian Peninsula , covering both Spain and Portugal , an Atlantic region which is crucial to the whole of Europe .
Mr President , this annual report clearly shows that Europe is not providing itself with the means to implement its trans-European transport networks policy .
But apart from the simple budgetary and financial considerations , in more general terms , it is the Commission &apos; s general guidelines in this area that are worthy of criticism .
We do agree , of course , with the principle that it is necessary to create trans-European networks for the people of Europe , for the movement of people and goods , for economic and social cohesion and for rail alternatives to the all-powerful motorway .
We cannot , however , accept the method that has been imposed or the solutions that have been proposed .
Are all the fourteen projects that have been accepted relevant or essential to the needs of local populations ?
Have they been devised in association or in consultation , or is the rationale of the trans-European networks , as the report implies , only based on the free market ?
It is , moreover , not by chance that out of the fourteen projects , the seven whose timetable and financing are still in doubt are precisely those which do not only answer to the demands of profit .
The most negative aspect , however , seems to be the financing .
It is based on the principle that public funds cannot be increased , which is a moot point .
It therefore proposes to have recourse to private funds , in the form of partnerships , and this , moreover , is an essential element of the project .
This approach to rail transport raises the issue of public service .
Clearly , if private operators are involved in the financing , they will aim for maximum profit .
We must make use of private companies because they profit from the infrastructures , but in the form of tax deductions and not by them having an interest in the capital of railway companies .
The idea of a European public rail service must be developed and we reject privatisation and access to the capital of rail companies , including for new projects .
Once again , Europe is responding to a genuine need on the part of the people , the need for a high-quality European rail transport network , which is outstanding for both passengers and staff , with a race for profit .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first let me thank our rapporteur very warmly for his report .
The European Commission &apos; s annual report on trans-European networks once again sets out the progress made with many transport projects and emphasises the important part the TENs play in protecting the environment .
