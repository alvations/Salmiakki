It may not be obvious , but air transport is not an end in itself : air transport moves capital , it moves industries - be it the tourist industry or some other industry - and it brings people into contact , not merely in the pursuit of leisure , but in order to clinch business deals.The contribution made by air transport to the European and global economies is truly great , and it should therefore be both promoted and regulated .

Then there is a problem of competition , particularly competition from the United States in the form of those huge carriers which are governed by standardised legislation which , I regret , is lacking in the European Union , both in the sphere of air traffic control - with the result that operational standardisation is lacking as well as legislative standardisation - and as regards the recognition of professional qualifications .

A key point raised by the rapporteur is the current situation in which , while the aviation industry is liberalised and operates in an open European market , the authorities which control the air space , the airports and the regulating bodies , as well as the companies providing services to the air transport sector , still operate from an excessively local point of view .

It is therefore proposed that airports , with all the strategic importance which they have for a country &apos; s safety , should be surrendered to the multinationals , despite the negative implications this would have , and that the aspirations of private-sector airport owners to reap maximum profits should be promoted .

It is also proposed that the sovereign right of each country to control air traffic in its air space should be surrendered to the European Union , on the pretext of establishing a uniform system of air safety.At the same time , the proposal calls for the privatisation of the operational bodies responsible for air traffic control which , it says , will be responsible for all the EU &apos; s air space and will compete with each other .

This proposal , aside from abrogating the sovereign right of each country over its own air space , will give rise to confusion and will have particularly negative and dangerous repercussions on air safety as , objectively speaking , the competition which is being vaunted here as the trump card will be competition for maximum profit and not for maximum air safety .

This ignores the indisputable fact , as the experience of official organisations and trade unions for workers in the civil aviation industry around the world has shown , that constant reductions in the running costs of aircraft and ground services , together with wall-to-wall privatisation and the private sector &apos; s goal of maximum profit , are the reason for the continuous rise in the number of air accidents .

Obviously , we have to push back the tide of fraud and the money which has been lost because of fraud needs , of course , to be traced.But the overall budget for this important , environmentally-friendly crop needs to be increased , and that is why the quotas which are now being laid down are inappropriate .

This certainly increased administrative expenditure considerably , but largely failed to achieve the desired , and necessary , effect : subsidy-hunting continued and the area under cultivation increased from around 100 000 hectares to 240 000 hectares , with the result that budgetary expenditure on this sector was , virtually , more than doubled .

Now if you combine our proposal to double the aid per hectare when proof is furnished with the proof for the processing aid , which also has to be provided , and if you join these two things together - of course this is not elaborated upon in the report - then the controls which need to be carried out for both kinds of premium are guaranteed and farmers do not lose out .

Obviously , we cannot in any way change either the law which has to be applied or the legal jurisdiction , but by now proposing a system whereby each insurer has a claims representative in every other country , we will probably be able , as far as the accident victim is concerned , satisfactorily to settle the claims arising from 90 % of all traffic accidents which take place in another country .

Nevertheless , although I will vote for the motion , I have to say that I am very perplexed by the response I have received from the Commission to my question on an issue which is not completely related to the question of accidents which take place abroad but which nevertheless concerns the insurance sector , a sector in which , as far as I am concerned , in Italy , truly unimaginable events occur , which leads me to suspect that Parliament &apos; s inspection system is , indeed , defunct .

A conference , sponsored by the &apos; Automobile Club d &apos; Italia &apos; , was held in Naples and attended by leading lawyers , because insurance companies , as was also the case in the past , are making Italian citizens pay different premiums according to where they live , claiming that they have to recoup their costs in the areas where there are a greater number of accidents .

Therefore , I feel that , like Parliament , in addition to developing this type of measure , such as that presented in the Rothley report , we should endeavour to take further steps to avoid blatant discrimination against citizens of the same country , and also extend an invitation to the insurance companies : while it is mandatory to be insured , it is also mandatory for the insurance companies to insure the citizens .

I think it makes a great deal of sense to debate priorities intensively first , before getting down to specific numbers.More importantly , I think it is most helpful to present the preliminary draft budget so early , thereby allowing time for intensive discussion .

Now to the budget proper : as with every national budget , most of the figures in the European budget for a given year are determined by contracts , by previous decisions in past years and by legal bases in past years .

This is particularly true of agricultural expenditure in the area of the organisation of the markets , the largest item in the budget , including in the Budget 2001 , and of the Structural Funds and multiannual programmes , be they in research , youth measures or foreign policy .

Despite the fact that figures are determined by previous years , the Budget 2001 also sets clear political priorities and , following discussions over recent months , I think I can say that the priorities in the Commission &apos; s preliminary draft budget tally to a large extent with Parliament &apos; s priorities .

Take , for example , the priority under the second pillar of agricultural policy ; the highest rate of increase in the Commission &apos; s preliminary draft budget is for promoting the development of rural areas and I think that this in fact highlights that the Commission considers that we need to focus on the second pillar of agricultural policy .

Secondly , economic policy prioritises the need to develop and promote Europe as a knowledge-based society , which is why the Commission &apos; s preliminary draft budget has set a very large plus against research and a new edition of the programme to promote small- and medium-sized enterprises and , more importantly , contains a proposal to combine them with the promotion of technology , which was also a matter of concern to the rapporteur , Mrs Haug .

I should point out that this figure for agricultural policy actually makes provision for the draft budget for agricultural policy to remain under the ceiling decided in Berlin because the Commission proposal includes shifting EUR 300 million from the agricultural budget to foreign policy , yet still there is such a high rate of growth for agricultural policy .

The rate of growth of payments is higher because we have a large backlog of payment commitments and the Commission currently takes the view that this should not get any bigger ; on the contrary it should be reduced , which is precisely why the rate of growth for payments needs to be higher .
